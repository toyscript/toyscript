Blue sky, fluffy clouds.

The TOY STORY logo. A branding iron sears a “3” into it. 

IMAGE bursts into FLAMES...

EXT. OLD WEST - DAY

A train races across the desert. MOVE IN on an ARMORED CAR. 

Suddenly, the roof blows open.

EXT. TRAIN - DAY

Money bags fly out. ONE-EYED BART (Mr. Potato Head) follows.

        ONE-EYED BART
    Money, money, money! Ha! Ha! Ha! 

Bart stashes the loot. Suddenly, a lasso yanks his arm off. 

        ONE-EYED BART
    Hey!

The lasso lifts him off his feet. He falls, dazed. A 
figure approaches -- WOODY. He pins Bart with his boot.

        WOODY
    You got a date with justice, One-Eyed 
    Bart!

        ONE-EYED BART
    Too bad, Sheriff -- I’m a married man.

A WAR CRY. Woody looks up.

        VOICE (O.S.)
    Ai! Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-yah!

A Ninja warrior, ONE-EYED BETTY (Mrs. Potato Head), flips 
down the train roof, wielding a sword and nun-chucks. 

        WOODY
    One-Eyed Betty!

Woody handsprings away. He gets to the end of the Caboose. 
Betty hits him with her purse. He teeters, then falls.

        WOODY
    Whoa, whoa... Ahhh...!

Bart and Betty laugh, peek over the edge...

                2

GALLOPING HOOVES

TILT UP to find Woody, riding BULLSEYE, JESSIE at the reins.

        JESSIE
    I believe you dropped something, 
    Mister!

        ONE-EYED BART 
    Jessie?!

        WOODY
    You’ve reached the end of the line, 
    Bart.

Bart pulls out a remote detonator.

        ONE-EYED BART
    I always wanted to go out with a 
    bang!

Ahead, a huge trestle bridge spans a canyon. ZOOM to 
REVEAL -- The middle of the bridge is loaded with dynamite. 

Bart laughs, hits the detonator. The bridge explodes.

Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye gasp.

        JESSIE
    Oh no! 

        WOODY
    The orphans!

WHIP PAN -- A train car of TROLLS lean out the windows.

One-Eyed Bart cackles.

        ONE-EYED BART
    Hate to leave early, but our ride is 
    here.

HONK-HONK! A pink Corvette, driven by the three ALIENS, 
pulls up alongside the train.

        ALIENS
    Oooooooooo!

        ONE-EYED BART
    It’s me or the kiddies, Sheriff! 
    Take your pick!

The Potato Heads leap off the train into the Corvette. 
They speed off. Woody looks at the out-of-control train. 

                3

        WOODY
    Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

Bullseye runs up next to the speeding locomotive. 

        WOODY
    Hold him steady...

Woody stands, then leaps from Bullseye into the locomotive. 

        JESSIE
    Woody, hurry!

Woody turns a gear, pulls the brake.

Train wheels lock. Sparks fly. Woody looks ahead.

POV -- The train skids toward the severed rails.

Bullseye and Jessie skid to a stop at the canyon edge.

Too late. Woody and the train plummet over the edge. 

Bullseye and Jessie are horrified.

        JESSIE
    No...!

From deep in the canyon, a FLASH and RUMBLE. 

Then, the entire train rises into the sky. 

Holding it from below is BUZZ LIGHTYEAR. 

        BUZZ
    Glad I could catch the train!

Woody leans out the front.

    WOODY
Now let’s catch some criminals! 

    BUZZ
To Infinity... And Beyond!

            CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT PLAINS

A large, hand-painted sign reads:
    Border Crossing
    One Mile
    Outlaws Welcome

                4

WHIP PAN -- The Corvette speeds past. 

The Outlaws laugh gleefully. Bart kisses his loot. 

The Aliens see something in the sky, point...

        ALIENS
    OooOOOOoooo!

Buzz flies out of the sun, firing his laser.

The Corvette is sliced in half. The halves fall away.

The Outlaws tumble into a heap.

Woody and Jessie step up. Buzz lands nearby, laser poised.

        WOODY
    Reach for the sky!

        ONE-EYED BART
    You can’t touch me, Sheriff! I 
    brought my attack dog with a 
    built-in force field!

Bart WHISTLES. 

From above, SLINKY springs down the canyon walls, coils 
crackling with energy. He circles the gang, bites his 
tail. An ENERGY BUBBLE forms around them. 

        WOODY
    Well, I brought my dinosaur, who eats 
    force-field dogs!

        JESSIE
    Yo-Dee-Le-Hi-HoooOOOOOOOO!

The Earth trembles. Cracks form. The ground bursts open. 

A giant REX emerges, BELLOWING.

He leans toward Bart, lets out a fearsome ROAR. 

A shadow. Rex stops. An intense HUM. Everyone looks up. 

An enormous, pig-shaped spaceship hovers above them.

        BUZZ
    Evil Dr. Porkchop!!!

We FLY UP to...

                5

INT. SPACESHIP - DAY

DR. PORKCHOP (Hamm) sits on the bridge, sporting a bowler. 

        EVIL DR. PORKCHOP
    That’s Mr. Evil Dr. Porkchop to you!

Bart, Betty, Slinky, and the Aliens are suddenly beamed up. 

Hamm flips open a switch. A red button: DEATH BY MONKEYS.

He pushes it. 

The ship’s belly swings open. A yellow barrel is dropped. 

The barrel falls. 

It explodes into a mushroom cloud of crazed red monkeys.

Woody, Buzz and Jessie flee. The Monkeys come after them.

Rex ROARS. The Monkeys swarm over him, taking him down.

Woody, Buzz and Jessie are overtaken and pinned down.

The spaceship’s snout rotates and opens. A giant laser 
cannon powers up with a deafening HUM. Bart LAUGHS and 
reaches for a button marked with a skull and crossbones...

Jessie turns away, eyes shut. 

Bart LAUGHS louder. 

Buzz turns away. 

Bart CACKLES -- finger on the trigger.

Woody grimaces...
 
                CUT TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY

Andy imitates One-Eyed Bart’s LAUGH.

On Woody and Buzz. Andy’s hands move Woody as he “talks”.

        YOUNG ANDY (AS WOODY)
    Buzz! Shoot your laser at my badge!

        YOUNG ANDY (AS BUZZ)
    Woody, no! It’ll kill you!

        YOUNG ANDY (AS WOODY)
    Just do it!

                6

Andy presses Buzz’s laser, makes a ricochet sound -- PSHOO! 
-- off Woody’s badge and traces a line into the air...

...Where Hamm, the Potato Heads and the Aliens perch on a 
winged cardboard box, crudely fashioned into a spaceship, 
that dangles from the ceiling. 

Andy hits the carton -- PPPKOOOOOSHHH!!! 

The Toys tumble to pillows on the floor. 

                CUT TO:

CAMCORDER POV - HANDHELD 

MOM’S hand pushes open a door. Andy, 8, in his cowboy hat, 
jumps around making EXPLOSION NOISES. 

He’s turned his room into a Western “set” complete with a 
Tinkertoy trestle bridge, a Barrel of Monkeys, etc.

        YOUNG ANDY 
        (as Woody)
    You’re going to jail, Bart. 

Camera ZOOMS IN. Andy looks up, stops.

        YOUNG ANDY
    Mom...!?

        MOM (O.C.)
    No, no...! Keep playing! Just 
    pretend I’m not here.

Suddenly, MOLLY, 2, toddles in, knocking over Tinker Toys.

        MOM (O.C.)
    Oh, no! Molly...!

        YOUNG ANDY
    No, it’s okay, Mom! It’s... A 50-
    foot baby from outer space! She’s 
    on a rampage! Run for your lives!

Andy races around. Chaos, laughing. Buster enters, BARKING. 

The CAMERA PIVOTS UPSIDE-DOWN, revealing Mom’s face.

        MOM
    Does the red light mean it’s going?

The TAPE GLITCHES and we JUMP TO... 
BEGIN MUSIC -- “You’ve Got A Friend In Me”

                7

INT. ANDY’S KITCHEN - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Molly sits in a high chair, party hat on, eating cake. 

Camera PANS Andy’s Toys, wearing party hats. End on Andy, 
holding Woody, stuffing cake in his mouth.

        MOM (O.C.)
    Come on, say ‘Happy Birthday’ to 
    Molly...

        YOUNG ANDY
    (mouth full)
    Happhy Brffday!

        MOM (O.C.)
    Oh, charming.

Andy holds Woody up to CAMERA, cake crumbs flying.

        YOUNG ANDY (AS WOODY)
    Happhy Brffday!!!

                JUMP TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Mom pencils a line above Andy’s head onto the door frame.

        MOM (O.C.)
    Look how tall you’re getting!

Andy steps away and beams. 

                JUMP TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Andy holds Woody against the door frame, marks a line above 
Woody’s head. ZOOM OUT to reveal lines and labels for all 
the toys, including for “Slinky” and “Slinky’s Butt”.

                JUMP TO:

EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Andy gives Woody a piggyback ride.

                JUMP TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Andy holds Buzz towards camera, shoots his laser. 

        BUZZ
    “Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!”

        ANDY (AS WOODY)
    Good work Buzz!

Andy makes Buzz and Woody high five.

                JUMP TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Andy lies in a pillow fort, surrounded by toys, eating from 
a huge bowl of popcorn, and watching an off-screen TV. 

He stuffs popcorn in Rex’s mouth, turns back to the TV. 
His eyes widen. The popcorn tumbles out of Rex’s mouth.

                JUMP TO:


EXT. ANDY’S FRONT YARD - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Andy rockets Jessie and Bullseye around the front yard, 
while Mom struggles to keep him in the FRAME.

                JUMP TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY - HANDHELD CAMCORDER POV

Andy, laughing, spins around, falls on his bed, pulls his 
toys close -- holding Woody, Buzz and Jessie in the warm, 
glowing embrace of a child’s innocent and boundless love. 

The song FADES on “Our friendship will never die...” 
FADE TO BLACK

        WOODY (V.O.)
    Okay -- places, everyone! C’mon, 
    get in position!

INT. TOY CHEST, ANDY’S ROOM - DAY

Dark, crowded. Toys crammed together. Light seeps in. 
Nervous, backstage jitters. They speak in HUSHED TONES.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Wait -- I can’t find my other eye!

                9
    
        HAMM
    Someone’s foot is in my face...

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    It’s mine! Give it back!

        ALIENS
    You saved our lives! We are 
    eternally grateful!

Potato Head groans. Buzz sits by the rim. Jessie climbs up.

        JESSIE
    Buzz, mind if I squeeze in next to 
    ya?!

        BUZZ
    Yes! No! I mean...! Why would I 
    mind?! Squeezing next to... You! 

He laughs, nervous. She grins. Finally, he turns away. 

        BUZZ (CONT'D)
    Is it hot in here?

        REX (O.S.)
    Here they come!

The Toys clamber to the rim and gaze out.

POV -- SARGE and two ARMY MEN slip in the room, dragging 
something in a gym sock. 

The Army Men arrive at the chest. Woody peers down.

        WOODY 
    Sarge! You got it...?!

        SARGE
    Mission accomplished!

The Toys are thrilled. The Army Men hoist the sock up.

        WOODY
    Careful...! Careful!!!

Buzz turns the sock upside-down. A cell phone slides out. 
Toys gather around.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    All right, guys. We got one shot at 
    this. Everyone ready?

	    JESSIE
    We’re ready, Woody! Let’s do it! 

                10

        WOODY
    Buzz -- make the call.

Buzz flips open his wrist cover. A phone number is written 
inside. Jessie pulls out a cordless phone, leans close to 
Buzz. Buzz chuckles, nervous. Jessie dials the phone. 

Woody tosses the cell phone to Rex. 

Jessie gets to the last digit, hits it. Silence. 

Suddenly, the cell phone RINGS. Rex yelps. 

Buzz, Jessie and Woody peer over the rim. FOOTSTEPS on the 
stairs.

        BUZZ
    Target is on approach.

Woody’s eyes are fixed on the door.

        WOODY 
    Just like we rehearsed it, guys... 

The door opens. ANDY enters but we only SEE his jean-clad 
legs. He scans the room, zeroes in on the toy chest. 

He lifts the lid REVEALING... 

Andy is a teenager. His hair is long and his voice deep, 
but he has the same kind face. He looks down, puzzled. 

The Toys lie, lifeless, amid sports equipment and clothing. 

The phone RINGS again. Andy’s hand rummages. 

Woody hugs the cordless as Andy’s fingers pass by and find 
the cell phone.

He pulls it out. The phone is stuck in Rex’s arms. Andy 
pulls. Rex clings. Andy finally yanks the phone loose.

        ANDY 
    Hello...?

CLOSE ON -- Woody, holding the phone. He closes his eyes. 

        ANDY (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
    Hello...?! Anyone there?

Andy hangs up, turns.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    Molly, stay outta my room!

                11

        MOLLY (O.S.)
    I wasn’t in your room!

Andy scoffs, looks down at Rex in his hand. Rex lies 
frozen, smiling -- eager to be played with. 

Andy drops Rex in the box, shuts the lid, heads out.

        ANDY 
    Then who was messing with my stuff?

        MOLLY (O.S.)
    It wasn’t me...!

He departs, closing the door -- CLICK. 

CREAK -- Woody and Buzz push the chest open, share a look. 
The other Toys climb out.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Well, that went well! 

They spill out onto the floor. The room has changed -- 
rock posters, guitar, skateboard, other teen detritus. 

        REX
    He held me! He actually held me! 

        HAMM
    Oh, this is just sad.

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Who are we kiddin’? The kid’s 
    seventeen years old!

Woody and Buzz jump down, exchange a glance. Buzz nods. 
Woody waves his arms.

        WOODY 
    Guys, hey, hold up! We need a staff 
    meeting! Everyone? A staff meeting!

GROANS of boredom.

        HAMM
    Not again...!

        WOODY 
    Oh, come on! Slink? Gather everyone 
    up!

        SLINKY
    Uh... We are gathered, Woody!

The Toy Community is a lot smaller. Woody rolls with it.

                12

        WOODY
    Okay. First off -- we all knew 
    Operation Playtime was a long shot...

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    More like a misfire! 

        WOODY
    ...But we’ve always said this job 
    isn’t about getting played with. 
    It’s about...

        JESSIE
    ...Being there for Andy. We know.

        REX
    But we can try again, right?

Woody looks at all of them. He shakes his head.

        WOODY
    I’m callin’ it, guys. We’re closin’ 
    up shop. 

Gasps. Everyone is crushed by this news. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Andy’s going to college any day 
    now... That was our last shot.

Mrs. Potato Head begins to sniffle. Buzz steps forward.

        BUZZ
    We’re going into Attic Mode, folks. 
    Keep your accessories with you at all 
    times -- spare parts, batteries... 
    Anything you need for an orderly 
    transition.

Potato Head steps up.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    “Orderly?” Don’t you get it?! We’re 
    done! Finished! Over the hill!

        WOODY
    Hey, hey, now come on, guys! We all 
    knew this day was coming!

Buzz, in FOREGROUND, sees something off-screen, frowns. 

POV -- Sarge and the Army Men climb up onto Andy’s desk. 

The other Toys keep arguing.

                13

        HAMM (O.C.)
    Yeah, but now its here!

        WOODY (O.C.)
    Look, every toy goes through this! 
    No one wants to see their kid leave! 

        BUZZ
    Hey! Sarge! What are you doing?!
    Everyone turns. Sarge and his last two Soldiers climb to 
    the window sill.

        SARGE
    War’s over, folks. Me ‘n the boys 
    are movin’ on.

        WOODY
    Moving on...?! 

        BUZZ
    You’re going AWOL?!

        SARGE
    We done our duty. Andy’s grown up.

        SOLDIER ONE
    And let’s face it -- when the trash 
    bags come out, we Army guys are the 
    first to go.

        BUZZ
    Trash bags...?! 

        WOODY
    Who said anything about trash bags?

        SARGE
    It has been an honor serving with 
    you. Good luck, folks.

Sarge straps in tandem with Soldier One. They leap. Their 
parachute opens and the wind carries them off. 

        SOLDIER TWO
    You’re gonna need it...!
    He jumps and flies off too. The Toys are stunned.

        WOODY
    No, no... Wait...! Wait! Wait!!!

        REX
    We’re getting thrown away?!

            14
	
        WOODY
    No! No one’s getting thrown away!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    How do you know?!
    Jessie begins to panic. 

        JESSIE
    We’re being abandoned...!

        BUZZ
    We’ll be fine, Jessie!

        HAMM
    So why did Sarge leave?!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Should we leave?!

        SLINKY
    I thought we were goin’ to the attic!

        REX
    Oh, I hate all this uncertainty...!

Woody turns, waves his arms.

        WOODY 
    Whoa, whoa! Hold on! Quiet!!!
    No one’s getting thrown out, okay?! 
    We’re all still here, aren’t we?!
    (beat)
    I mean, yeah, we’ve lost friends 
    along the way -- Wheezy and Etch 
    and...

        REX
    Bo Peep...?

Woody nods, stoic.

        WOODY
    Even... Even Bo. All good toys 
    who’ve gone on to new owners. But 
    through every yard sale, every spring 
    cleaning, Andy held on to us. He must
    care about us or we wouldn’t be here. 
    You wait -- Andy’s gonna tuck us in 
    the attic. It’ll be safe and warm...

        BUZZ
    ...And we’ll all be together. 

            15

        WOODY
    Exactly. There’s games up there, and 
    books... And, and...

        BUZZ
    The race-car track...

        WOODY
    The race-car track. Thank you!

        SLINKY
    And the old TV...!

        WOODY
    There you go -- the old TV! And 
    those guys from the Christmas 
    decorations box! They’re fun, right?

The Toys shrug, MURMUR in semi-agreement. Woody softens.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    And someday -- if we’re lucky -- Andy 
    may have kids of his own...

        REX
    And he’ll play with us then, right?

Woody looks at Rex, unable to say “yes”.

        WOODY
    We’ll always be there for him.

        BUZZ
    Come on, guys! Let’s get our parts 
    together, get ready, and go out on a 
    high note.

The Toys disperse.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    I’d better find my other eye...

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Where’d ya leave it this time?

She puts a hand over her empty eye socket.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Someplace dark. And dusty!

Hamm turns to Rex.

        HAMM
    C’mon. Let’s see how much we’re 
    goin’ for on eBay...

            16

Woody watches as the Toys trudge off. 

        WOODY
    Don’t worry. Andy’s gonna take care 
    of us. I guarantee it.

ON THE DRESSER 

Woody climbs up, surveys the room -- posters, guitar, 
textbooks. He turns to a cork board where Andy’s high 
school graduation photo is pinned. He lifts it to find...

A SNAPSHOT shows an eight-year-old Andy wearing a cowboy 
hat and posing with Woody and Buzz and all of Andy’s toys.
Woody gazes at the halcyon past he can never return to. 
Buzz steps up behind him.

        BUZZ
    You guarantee it, huh...?

        WOODY
    I dunno, Buzz. What else could I say?

        BUZZ 
    Whatever happens, at least we’ll be 
    together.

CLOSE ON -- The SNAPSHOT of young Andy. 

        WOODY (O.C.)
    For Infinity and Beyond...

FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Woody and Buzz turn.

        MOLLY (O.S.)
    Can I have your stereo?

        ANDY (O.S.)
    No!

        MOLLY (O.S.)
    Why not?

        ANDY (O.S.)
    ‘Cause I’m taking it with me!

The Toys scramble back into the toy chest. Andy enters 
with Molly close behind.

        MOLLY
    Can I have your computer?

            17

        ANDY
    No!

        MOLLY
    Your video games?

        ANDY
    Forget it, Molly!

Molly sighs, walks off. Andy starts typing on his laptop. 
Andy’s Mom enters carrying cardboard boxes and trash bags.

        MOM
    Okay, Andy, let’s get to work here. 
    Anything you’re not taking to college 
    either goes in the attic, or it’s 
    trash.

She picks up a box and writes “College” in magic marker. 
Andy stares at his computer.

        ANDY
    Mom, I’m not leaving ‘til Friday!

        MOM
    C’mon -- it’s garbage day.

        ANDY
    Mom...!

She picks up his skateboard, puts it in the “College” box.

        MOM
    Look, it’s simple: Skateboard? 
    College. Little league trophy? 
    Probably attic. Apple core? Trash. 
    You can do the rest.

She tosses an apple core in a trash bag, hands it to Andy. 
Molly opens the Toy Chest.

        MOLLY
    Why do you still have these Toys?

        ANDY
    Molly, out of my room...!

        MOLLY 
    Three more days and it’s mine...!

She strides out the door. 

        MOM 
    Molly, you’re not off the hook either!

            18

THE TOY CHEST 

The Toys watch as Mom picks up a box, enters Molly’s room.

        MOM (CONT'D)
    You have more toys than you know what 
    to do with. Some of ‘em could make 
    other kids really happy...

        MOLLY
    What kids...?

        MOM
    The children at the day care. 
    They’re always asking for donations.

Rex whispers.

        REX
    What’s “day care”?

        WOODY
    Shhh...!!!

Mom writes SUNNYSIDE on the box. Molly pouts.

        MOLLY 
    But, Mom...

        MOM
    No “buts”. You choose the toys you 
    wanna donate. I’ll drop ‘em off at 
    Sunnyside.

Mom leaves. Molly sighs -- Moms! -- surveys the room. She 
picks up a xylophone, a Magic 8-Ball, puts them in the box. 

She picks up her old Barbie. 

MOLLY POV -- Barbie smiles, desperately eager to please.

Molly, indifferent, tosses Barbie into the box, then buries 
her face in a “Teen” magazine. 

THE TOY CHEST

Across the hall, the Toys react.

        JESSIE
    Poor Barbie...!

        HAMM
    I get the Corvette.

            19

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY

Mom walks back and finds Andy still on his laptop.

        MOM
    Andy, come on -- you need to start 
    making decisions.

        ANDY
    Like what?

She pulls open the toy chest.

        MOM 
    Like, what are you gonna do with 
    these toys? Should we donate ‘em to 
    Sunnyside?

        ANDY
    No...!

        MOM
    Maybe sell them online...?

        ANDY 
    Mom -- no one’s gonna want those old 
    toys. They’re junk!

THE TOYS

Silently hear this bombshell. Mom lowers the lid.

        MOM
    Fine. You have ‘til Friday -- 
    anything that’s not packed for 
    college, or in the attic, is getting 
    thrown out.

        ANDY
    “Whatever you say, Mom.”

He stares at his laptop. She shakes her head, exits. 

Andy sighs, closes his laptop. He turns, surveys his room.

He rolls his chair to the toy chest and opens the lid.

Inside are the Toys -- his old friends. They lie frozen, 
smiling, forever eager to play. 

Andy gazes at them, making a decision.

Abruptly, he grabs a trash bag, snaps it open. He picks up 
the Toys -- Rex, Potato Head, Jessie -- tosses them in. 

            20

He pulls Hamm’s cork, empties the change out, and dumps 
him, with rest of the Toys, in the trash bag. 

Then Andy picks up Buzz and Woody, looks at them.

POV -- Buzz, grinning and heroic. Woody, smiling and loyal.

TOYS POV -- Andy turns, tosses Woody in the College box.

The Toys gasp. Andy drops Buzz into the garbage bag. 

IN THE BAG

Buzz is stunned and hurt.

Andy cinches the bag closed and carries it from the room. 

Behind him, Woody pops up from the College box, shocked.

IN THE BAG

It’s dim and crowded. 

        REX
    What’s happening...?!!!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    We’re getting thrown out, you idiot! 
    That’s what’s happening!!!

Woody jumps from the box, runs across the room, hides 
behind the door frame.

Andy walks onto the hall landing, reaches up, and pulls 
open a trapdoor ladder that leads to the attic.

Woody watches, relieved.

Andy begins climbing to the attic. One rung... Two... 

Molly enters the hall landing, struggling with her box. 
It hits the door frame. A Magic 8-Ball falls out.

        ANDY
    You need a hand?

        MOLLY
    I got it...

Andy steps down, leaves the bag at the foot of the ladder, 
grabs the 8-Ball. He helps Molly carry her box downstairs.

        ANDY
    Here. So, you gonna miss me when I’m 
    gone?
 
            21

        MOLLY 
    If I say ‘no’, do I still get your 
    room?

        ANDY
    Nope.

        MOLLY 
    Then, yes, I’ll miss you.

They disappear.

IN THE BAG

The Toys are piled all over each other. Jessie is hyper-ventilating. Buzz looks around -- plotting his next move.

        JESSIE
    I can’t breathe!

        REX
    This can’t be happening!!!

        BUZZ
    Quiet...!!!! What’s that sound?

They all listen. A faint CREAKING.

ON THE LANDING

The attic ladder -- spring loaded -- retracts, pushing the 
toy-filled trash bag out of the way.

IN THE BAG

The bag is tipped over. The Toys tumble over each other.

        TOYS
    Whooaaaaa...!!!

ON THE LANDING

The ladder pushes free and rises to the ceiling, retracting 
completely. Woody tiptoes into the hall toward the bag.

Suddenly, Mom enters carrying a trash bag. Woody retreats. 
Mom trips over the toy-filled bag, looks down -- irritated.

        MOM
    Andy...?!

No answer. Mom sighs, picks up the toy-filled bag and 
exits, carrying it downstairs.

            22

ANDY’S ROOM

Woody -- at the door -- is electrified.

        WOODY
    That’s not trash! That’s not trash!!

He steps back, mind reeling.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Think, Woody...! Think! Think!
    (an idea)
    Oooh! 
    (whistles)
    Buster! C’mere, boy! C’mere!

Off-screen PAWS and the JINGLE of a dog collar. Buster 
enters -- old, saggy, panting. Woody vaults onto his back.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Okay, boy! To the curb! Hyah!!!

Buster yawns and flops over, pinning Woody under him. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    No, Buster, no...! 

Woody grabs Buster by the jowls, pulls him backwards. 
Finally, Buster rolls over. Woody sits up, gasping.

Off-screen, a door SLAMS. Woody turns.

Woody rushes to the window, gazes out. 

POV -- Mom drops the trash bags at the curb. 

WHIP PAN -- Rumbling up the street is a garbage truck. 

Woody gasps.

IN THE BAG

Mounting panic. 

        JESSIE
    We’re on the curb! 

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Oh, I knew it would come to this!

Buzz grabs the side of the bag, tries to tear it open. 

        BUZZ
    Pull, everyone! Pull!!!

            23

EXT. ANDY’S HOUSE - DAY

Woody grabs a pair of scissors, shoves them in his holster. 
He lunges for the drainpipe, slides down, hits a gutter and 
tumbles into the bushes below. CRASH!

IN THE BAG

The Toys follow Buzz’s lead, pulling the sides of the bag. 

        REX
    It won’t rip!

        HAMM
    Ah, forget it! It’s triple-ply high-density polyethylene!

        BUZZ 
    There’s gotta be a way out! 

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Andy doesn’t want us! What’s the 
    point?

        BUZZ
    (thinking)
    Point... Point... POINT!!!

Buzz looks at Rex’s pointy tail.

OUTSIDE THE BAG

The truck RUMBLES closer, two driveways away.

IN THE BAG

The Toys follow Buzz, shoving Rex backwards.

        BUZZ (CONT'D)
    Push! Push!!! 

        REX
    I can hear the garbage truck!

OUTSIDE THE BAG

The bag stretches. Rex’s tail is nearly through.

IN THE BAG

        REX (CONT'D)
    It’s getting closer-fffmmm!

Rex is muffled by a mouthful of plastic.

            24

IN THE YARD

Woody uses the scissors to snip his way out of the bush. 
The garbage truck approaches Andy’s driveway. 

Woody races out, dives behind the mail box post. The 
GARBAGE MAN is in head phones, playing air guitar, drumming 
the mail box. He empties a garbage can into the truck.

Woody ducks from behind the post, plunges his scissors into 
a garbage bag. 

Garbage spills out: wrong bag. He tries another. No luck.

As the Garbage Man turns, Woody ducks behind the post. The 
Garbage Man grabs the last bags, tosses them in the truck.

He climbs on a running board, SLAPS the side. 

The truck shifts into gear and lurches off down the street.

THE STREET

As the truck rumbles off, Woody ducks from behind the mail 
box, runs after it. The truck pulls up at the next house. 
Woody hides behind a fire hydrant.

The Garbage Man hops off the runner, yanks a lever. The 
truck’s compactor lowers, scoops up the trash bags. 

From behind the hydrant, Woody watches in horror.

The compactor retracts, CRUNCHING the bags remorselessly.

        WOODY 
    Buzz...!!! Jessie...!!!

A TINKLE. Woody turns. In Andy’s driveway, an upside-down 
recycling bin scurries on little feet into the garage. 

Woody sighs, relieved.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

The Toys cast off the bin. They are traumatized. 

        SLINKY
    Andy threw us out...! 

        HAMM
    Like we were garbage...!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    “Junk”! He called us “junk”! 

            25

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    How could he...?!

She SOBS on Mr. Potato Head’s shoulder. 

        BUZZ
    (to himself)
    This doesn’t make any sense...!

Jessie is furious.

        JESSIE
    I should’a seen this coming! It’s 
    Emily all over again!

She turns and scans the garage -- galvanized, determined.

        HAMM
    Sarge was right...!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Yeah! And Woody was wrong!

        BUZZ
    Wait a minute! Hold on! This is no 
    time to be hysterical.

        HAMM
    It’s the perfect time to be 
    hysterical!

        REX
    (hysterical)
    Should we be hysterical...?!!!

        SLINKY
    No!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Yes!

        BUZZ
    Maybe! But not right now!

        JESSIE (O.S.)
    Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeee--hawwwwwwwwww...!!!

Everyone turns. Jessie is smiling.

        JESSIE (CONT'D)
    Fellas -- I know what to do!

They follow her gaze. In the hatchback of Mom’s car is 
Molly’s box of toys, marked SUNNYSIDE.

            26
 
EXT. ANDY’S YARD - DAY

Woody darts from a tree to a landscape boulder, sneaking 
towards the garage. He peeks out from behind a flowerpot.

        WOODY
    What the heck...?!

WOODY’S POV -- The Toys clamber into the Donation Box.

INT. CAR / GARAGE - DAY

Buzz stands outside the Donation Box as the other Toys 
clamber in. Jessie helps the Aliens up into the box.

        JESSIE
    We should’a done this years ago! 

        BUZZ
    Jessie, wait...! What about Woody?!

        JESSIE
    He’s fine, Buzz! Andy’s takin’ him 
    to college! Now we need to go!

    Buzz looks at her and the others.

        BUZZ
    You’re right. Come on!

He helps pass the Aliens up. Woody approaches, incredulous.

        WOODY 
    Buzz...? 

        BUZZ
    Woody...!

        WOODY
    What’s going on? Don’t you know this 
    box is being donated!

        BUZZ
    It’s under control! We have a plan!

        REX
    We’re going to Day Care!

        WOODY 
    Day Care?! What -- have you all lost 
    your marbles?!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Didn’t you see? Andy threw us away! 

            27

        WOODY
    No...! No, no, no! He was putting 
    you in the attic!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Attic? So how’d we end up on the 
    curb?!

        WOODY
    That was a mistake! Andy’s Mom 
    thought you were trash! 

        HAMM
    Yeah! After he put us in a trash 
    bag!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    And called us “junk”!

        WOODY
    I know it looks bad but, guys, ya 
    gotta believe me!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Sure thing, “College Boy”!

        JESSIE 
    Andy’s movin’ on, Woody! It’s time 
    we did the same.

Jessie and the others duck in the box, pull the flaps shut. 

        WOODY 
    Okay, out of the box! Everyone, right 
    now! Come on! Buzz -- gimme a hand. 
    We gotta get this thing outta here!

He walks around and tries to push the box out of the car. 

        BUZZ 
    Woody -- wait! We need to figure out 
    what’s best for every--...

SLAM!!! The hatchback shuts. 

Buzz and Woody turn. Through the window, Andy’s Mom walks 
to the driver’s seat, gets in. Woody and Buzz crouch down. 

        WOODY
    Oh, great! Great!!! It’s gonna take 
    us forever to get back here!

The car lurches into gear and drives off.

            28

INT. DONATION BOX / CAR - DAY

The Toys have gathered around Barbie, who is sniffling. 
Mrs. Potato Head pats her shoulder. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    It’s all right, Barbie. You’ll be 
    okay!

Barbie nods, putting on a brave front.

        BARBIE
    Well... Molly and I have been growing 
    apart for years, it’s just... I can’t 
    believe she would throw me away! 

She breaks down again. Potato Head rolls his eyes.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Welcome to the club, Toots!

Suddenly, the box flaps open and Woody and Buzz vault in.

        WOODY
    Okay, everyone, listen up... We can 
    get back to Andy’s but we gotta move 
    fast. We’ll hide under the seats 
    ‘til we get home...

The Toys react, incensed.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Get it through your vinyl noggin, 
    Woody -- Andy doesn’t want us anymore! 

        WOODY
    He was putting you... In the 
    attic!!! 

Jessie goes toe-to-toe with Woody.

        JESSIE 
    He left us... On the curb! 

Buzz intervenes.

        BUZZ
    Alright, calm down! Both of you! 

        WOODY
    Okay, fine! Just wait’ll you see 
    what Day Care’s like!

        REX
    Why...?! What’s it like?!

            29

        WOODY
    Day Care is a sad, lonely place for 
    washed-up old toys who have no 
    owners.

Abruptly, Barbie bursts into tears.

        HAMM
    Quite the charmer, aren’t ya?

        WOODY 
    Oh, you’ll see! As soon as we get to 
    Day Care, you’ll be begging to go home. 

The car hits a bump and Woody tumbles.

EXT. DAY CARE, PARKING LOT - DAY

The car pulls into a modest day care center -- Sunnyside -- 
a cinder block building with bright, kid-friendly murals.

INT. / EXT. DONATION BOX / PARKING LOT - DAY

Andy’s Mom pulls out the box, carries it across the lot. 
Inside the box, the Toys peer out the hand slots.

        REX
    Can anyone see anything?

        JESSIE
    There’s a playground...!

Through fencing we SEE glimpses of kids running and playing 
with SHOUTS and LAUGHTER. The Toys look at each other.

        JESSIE 
    We hit the jackpot, Bullseye! 

        HAMM
    So much for “sad and lonely”, eh?

        WOODY
    Okay, calm down, guys. Let’s keep 
    this in perspective...

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Perspective?! This place is perfect!

        REX (CONT'D)
    Woody, it’s nice! See, the door has 
    a rainbow on it!

            30

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Andy’s Mom is BUZZED through glass doors. A RECEPTIONIST 
behind a counter types at a computer while a small girl on 
the counter plays with a toy chimp. Andy’s Mom enters.

        MOM
    Hey, there!

        RECEPTIONIST
    Wow! Haven’t seen you in ages... 

        MOM
    Just wanted to drop these old toys off.

She puts the box on the counter.

        MOM (CONT'D)
    Is this Bonnie?! Look how big you are! 

The girl, BONNIE, looks up, then turns to her Mother, shy.

        RECEPTIONIST
    Say hi, sweetie!

        BONNIE
    Hi.

        RECEPTIONIST 
    How are your kids? Molly and Andy?

        MOM
    Not kids anymore. Andy’s going to 
    college on Friday. Can you believe?

The Receptionist opens the box. Bonnie tries to look in.

        RECEPTIONIST 
    You sure they won’t miss these?

        MOM 
    Nah, they never get played with.

Mom departs and the Receptionist folds up the box flaps.

INT. DONATION BOX / HALLWAY - DAY

The Toys peek out as they are carried down a hallway. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    You see any kids...?

        REX
    Where’s she taking us?

            31

INT. DONATION BOX / BUTTERFLY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Box is placed on a counter. The Receptionist departs. 
In the box, the Toys step up and jostle for a view.

        JESSIE
    Look...!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Wow!

        REX
    What?! What is it?!!!

TOYS’ POV -- An idyllic day care classroom, filled with the 
happy bustle of four- and five-year-olds, playing with toys 
-- dinosaurs, a baby doll, a pink Teddy bear, a Ken doll.

The Toys stare, agog. Rex jockeys for a peek.

        REX (CONT'D)
    Aaah! I can’t see! 

A bell RINGS. A TEACHER opens the playground door.

        BUTTERFLY ROOM TEACHER
    Okay, everyone, recess! C’mon! 

The kids CHEER and flood out on the playground. The 
Teacher turns off lights, shuts the door behind her. 

IN THE BOX 

Silence. The room is still. The Toys speak sotto.

        HAMM
    So, now what do we do?

        WOODY
    We go back to Andy’s! Anyone see an 
    exit?

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Exit schmexit! Let’s get played 
    with!

        BUZZ
    Careful! These toys might be jealous 
    of new arrivals!

        REX
    I wanna see! It’s my turn!

Rex presses in. The Toys react.

            32

        BUZZ 
    Oooff...!!!

        SLINKY
    Whoa!

        HAMM
    Hey!

The whole box tilts and falls off the counter -- SPLAT!!! 

The Toys spill out. They look up.

Around the room, all the Day Care Toys stare back. 

A Jack In The Box pops up.

        JACK IN THE BOX
    New Toys! 

They all CHEER and burst into smiles.

Jessie shakes hands with a ROCK MONSTER toy.

        JESSIE
    Well, howdy! Glad to meetcha!

Buzz extends his hand to a ROBOT toy.

        BUZZ
    Buzz Lightyear, at your service.

Hamm, Slinky and Barbie shake hands with an OCTOPUS toy.

        HAMM
    Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

Rex laughs, circled by adoring little dinosaurs. 

An Insect Man ACTION FIGURE helps Mrs. Potato Head get up.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Oooh, thank you!
    (reaches for his bicep)
    Oh, may I? Ohhh!

He flexes obligingly. She feels his arm, GIGGLES. Mr. 
Potato Head looks on. He flexes his own arm. It sags. 

A Crane toy circles the Aliens. They gaze up, rapturous.

        ALIENS
    The Claw...!!!

SFX -- HONK! HONK! Everyone turns. 

            33

A Tonka Truck races forward, then backs up in a quick 180 
arc, revealing a large pink Teddy bear, LOTSO, in its bed. 

Lotso taps a Tinker Toy cane and the truck bed rises, 
“dumping” him out. Like Bob Hope stepping off the links in 
Palm Springs, Lotso exudes an easy, cheerful charisma. 

        LOTSO
    Well, hello there! I thought I heard 
    new voices! Welcome to Sunnyside, 
    folks! I’m Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear! 
    But, please, call me Lotso! 

Buzz steps up, offers a hand.

        BUZZ
    Buzz Lightyear. We come in pea...

Lotso grabs Buzz, lifts him in a smothering hug. 

        LOTSO
    (chuckling)
    First thing you gotta know about 
    me... I’m a hugger!!

He releases Buzz, looks at the other Toys.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Oh, look at y’all! You been through 
    a lot today, haven’t you? 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Oh, it’s been horrible!

        LOTSO
    Well, you’re safe now. We’re all
    cast-offs here -- we been dumped, 
    donated, yard-saled, second-handed, 
    and just plain thrown out. But just 
    you wait -- you’ll find being donated 
    was the best thing that ever happened 
    to ya! 

Woody scoffs, but Rex steps up excitedly.

        REX 
    Mr. Lotso...? Do toys here get 
    played with every day?

        LOTSO
    All day long. Five days a week.

        JESSIE
    But what happens when the kids grow 
    up?

            34

Lotso steps to a wall of day-care class photos.

        LOTSO
    Well, now, I’ll tell ya -- when the 
    kids get old, new ones come in. When 
    they get old, new ones replace them. 
    You’ll never be outgrown or 
    neglected. Never abandoned or 
    forgotten. No owners means no 
    heartbreak. 

The Toys are overjoyed. Even Woody is taken by this vision.

        JESSIE
    Yeee-hawww..!!! 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    It’s a miracle!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    (to Woody)
    And you wanted us to stay at Andy’s!

        WOODY
    Because we’re Andy’s toys!

Lotso puts an arm around Woody.

        LOTSO
    So you got donated by this “Andy”, 
    huh? Well, it’s his loss, Sheriff! 
    He can’t hurt you no more.

        WOODY
    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 

Lotso cuts him off.

        LOTSO
    Now let’s get you all settled in. 
    Ken?! Where is that boy? Ken...?! 
    New toys!

A Ken doll appears in an upper window of a doll house. 

        KEN 
    Far out! Hey, hi, everybody! 
    (to Lotso)
    Down in a jiff, Lotso!

He rides down in an elevator and opens the door. 

ON KEN -- Slip-on shoes, double-pleated shorts, and an 
unbuttoned animal-print shirt that reveals his ripped abs. 
He addresses the Toys with an air of boundless self-regard.

            35

        KEN (CONT'D)
    So. Who’s ready for Ken’s Dream Tour?

        LOTSO
    Let’s show our new friends where 
    they’ll be stayin’!

        KEN 
    Folks, if you wanna step right this--

He turns, sees Barbie. She looks up, sees him. 

Sparks fly. MUSIC swells. Destiny calls. They approach.

        KEN (CONT'D)
    Hi! I’m Ken.

        BARBIE
    Barbie. 
    (breathless)
    Have we ever me--...?

        KEN
    Huh-uh...! I would’ve remembered!
    (Barbie GIGGLES)
    Love your leg warmers.

        BARBIE
    Nice ascot.

Lotso breaks the spell.

        LOTSO
    C’mon, Ken! Recess don’t last 
    forever!

        KEN 
    Right on, Lotso! This way everyone!

He extends a gentlemanly arm. Barbie giggles, takes it.

        LOTSO
    You got a lot to look forward to, folks 
    -- the Little Ones love new toys!

He leads them off. Rex, Buzz, and Woody trail behind.

        BUZZ
    What a nice bear!

        REX
    And he smells like strawberries!

Woody sighs, exasperated. 

            36

As they walk, Ken addresses the Toys like a tour leader.

        KEN
    Folks, if I can share, here at 
    Sunnyside, we’ve got, well, just 
    about anything a Toy could ask for.

Lotso leads them past shelves of toy supplies.

        LOTSO
    Spare parts, super glue, and enough 
    fresh batteries to choke a Hungry-Hungry Hippo.

CLOSET DOOR

Lotso flings open a utility closet, revealing a spa-like 
workshop in which smaller Toys fix up bigger Toys -- 
stitching rips, etc. The Toys gasp, impressed.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Think you’re gettin’ old? Well, stop 
    your worryin’!

        KEN 
    Our repair spa will keep you stuffed, 
    puffed, and lightly buffed!

An Elephant plushie is getting his belly re-stuffed. He 
SNEEZES. Stuffing flies everywhere.

IN THE CLASSROOM

As the tour continues, Ken gestures to his Dream House. 

        KEN (CONT'D)
    And this, well, this is where I live 
    -- Ken’s Dream House. It has a disco, 
    it’s got a dune buggy... And a whole 
    room just for trying on clothes.

        BARBIE
    You have everything!!!

        KEN
    Everything except someone to share it 
    with.

He looks down, walks off. Barbie sighs, about to faint. 

Lotso reaches a bathroom door at the end of the room.

        LOTSO
    You need anything at all, you just 
    come talk to me. Here we are...!

            37

Lotso raps the door with his cane. It’s opened by a large 
baby doll, BIG BABY, with a lazy, drooping eye. Big Baby 
COOS, peers out at the Toys. They stare up in wonder. 

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don’t 
    you come meet our new friends?

He throws an arm around Big Baby in Toy-solidarity.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Poor Baby! We were thrown out 
    together, me n’ him. Abandoned by 
    the same owner!

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Lotso leads the Toys through a bathroom. 

        LOTSO
    But we don’t need owners here at 
    Sunnyside! We own ourselves! We’re 
    masters of our own fate...! We 
    control our own destiny!

Mr. Potato Head slips and falls, losing his parts.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Uh, watch out for puddles...

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY

Lotso leads the Toys into a new classroom. The Day Care 
Toys here are scuffier and more toddler-appropriate. 

        LOTSO
    And here’s where you folks’ll be 
    staying -- the Caterpillar Room! 

The Toys gaze up in awe. There’s kid stuff everywhere: 
tiny tables and chairs, finger paintings, wood blocks, 
banners of the alphabet, wire cubby bins, etc. The whole 
beautiful, child-centric universe of day care. 

        JESSIE
    Look at this place!

        BUZZ 
    [Whistles]

        HAMM
    Holy moly, guacamole!

            38

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Jackpot, baby!

        SLINKY
    Whoa, puppy!

        REX
    Wow!

A TOY TRAIN weaves through the room, blowing its WHISTLE. 
The Potato Heads look around in wonder.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    (fighting tears)
    It’s so beautiful! 

Woody is awestruck. Something nudges him. A RINGING. 

        WOODY
    What the...?

He looks down. An old Fisher Price Chatter Telephone is 
bumping into him. Woody kneels down, friendly.

        Woody (CONT'D)
    Oh, hey, little fella...

        LOTSO
    How long’s it been since y’all got 
    played with?

        SLINKY
    It’s been years! 

        LOTSO 
    Well, just you wait. In a few minutes 
    that bell’s gonna ring and you’ll get 
    the playtime you’ve been dreaming of. 

        REX
    Play! Real play!!! I can’t wait!!! 

        LOTSO
    Now, if you’ll excuse us, we best be 
    headin’ back. Welcome to Sunnyside, 
    folks!

Lotso climbs back into the Tonka Truck. The Toys wave.

        REX
    Thank you!

        HAMM
    Thank you there, Buddy Boy!

            39

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Take care, Pinky!

        BUZZ
    Goodbye, Mr. Lotso! Thank you!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Goodbye...! 

Barbie turns to Ken -- an end-of-the-first-date moment.

        BARBIE
    Will I see you again?

        KEN
    Oh, I’ll see you tonight. In my 
    dreams.

She giggles. They stare. It’s like they could both 
spontaneously combust. At the bathroom door, Lotso waits.

        LOTSO
    Ken...! Let’s get a move on! 

Ken turns to Barbie, takes her hands.

        KEN 
    Barbie, come with me! Live in my 
    Dream House! I know it’s crazy! I 
    know we’ve just met! Aw, heck -- you 
    don’t know me from GI Joe. But when 
    I look at you I feel like we were...

        KEN & BARBIE
    ...Made for each other!

They gasp, thunderstruck. Barbie turns, gazes to the Toys. 
Jessie grins and winks. Mrs. Potato Head waves -- Go! 

        BARBIE
    Yay!

She gives a leg kick. Ken pumps his fist. 

        KEN
    Yessssssss...!!!

Lotso calls again.

        LOTSO
    Ken...! 

        KEN
    Coming, Lotso!

            40

Ken leads Barbie to the Truck and they hop in, giddy. 
Lotso taps his cane and the Truck roars off. Big Baby is 
the last to exit, closing the door -- CLICK -- behind them. 

Through windows, children are heard LAUGHING and PLAYING. 
The Toys turn and wander toward the playground door. 

        HAMM
    Sounds like kids to me...!

        REX
    Oh, I wanna get played with! Why 
    can’t time go faster?!!!

        JESSIE
    How many ya reckon are out there?!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Oh, they sound so sweet!

Woody looks at them, knowing he’s fighting a losing battle.

        WOODY
    Look, everyone, it’s nice here, I 
    admit. But we need to go home...!

The Toys glance at each other. Jessie steps forward.

        JESSIE
    We can have a whole new life here, 
    Woody. A chance to make kids happy 
    again. 

        SLINKY
    Why don’t you stay?

        REX
    Yeah, Woody! Stay with us!

        HAMM
    Come on, Woodster!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    You’ll get played with...!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Stay here!

        JESSIE
    You can make a new kid happy!

        WOODY
    I can’t! No, no! Guys, really, no!

The Toys are taken aback. Woody struggles to stay calm.

            41

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    I have a kid. You have a kid -- 
    Andy! And if he wants us at college, 
    or in the attic, well, then our job 
    is to be there for him! Now I’m 
    going home! Anyone wants to join me 
    is welcome! C’mon, Buzz!

He heads off. Buzz stays put. Woody turns back.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Buzz...?

Buzz -- torn -- steps up to Woody, sober and gentle. 

        BUZZ
    Our mission with Andy’s complete, 
    Woody.

        WOODY
    What...?! 

        BUZZ
    And what’s important now is we stay 
    together.

        WOODY
    We wouldn’t even be together if it 
    weren’t for Andy! Look under your 
    boot, Buzz! You too, Jessie! Whose 
    name is written there?

The Toys stare at the ground. Rex pipes up.

        REX
    Maybe Andy doesn’t care about us any 
    more?

        WOODY
    Of course he does! He cares about 
    all of you! He was putting you in 
    the attic -- I saw! You can’t just 
    turn your back on him now!

Jessie steps forward -- incensed.

        JESSIE
    Woody -- wake up! It’s over! Andy 
    is all grown up!

Woody stares, trying to contain his anger. 

        WOODY 
    Okay, fine! Perfect! I can’t 
    believe how selfish you all are.

            42

Jessie glares back. No one moves. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    So this is it? After all we’ve been 
    through?

Buzz steps forward, offers a handshake. Woody looks at 
Buzz. He fixes his hat, turns away. Buzz is stung. 
Woody walks to the hall door. Bullseye follows.
 
        WOODY (CONT’D)
    Bullseye, no. You need to stay!

He moves on. Bullseye again tries to follow.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Bullseye, no! I said stay!
    (softens)
    Look -- I don’t want you left alone 
    in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

Bullseye retreats. Jessie puts a consoling hand on him. 
KEYS in a LOCK. The Toys turn.

        BONNIE’S MOM (O.S.)
    Bonnie...? Bonnie!

Woody looks at them, doesn’t know what else to say.

        WOODY 
    I gotta go.

The Toys scatter. Woody hides behind the door just as 
Bonnie’s Mom enters.

        BONNIE’S MOM
    Bonnie? You in here?

Woody sneaks out the door, into the hall.

CLOSE ON -- Buzz and Jessie, watching.

INT. HALLWAY

TEACHERS CHAT at the end of the hallway.

Woody peeks out from behind a garbage can, tip-toes into 
the hall, turns. A janitor cart approaches. Woody falls 
limp. The cart passes over Woody, leaving the hall empty.

A whistling JANITOR pushes the cart down the hallway. 
TILT DOWN to FIND Woody holding the underside of the cart.

            43

WOODY POV -- He rolls through the lobby, toward the exit...

        WOODY
    C’mon, c’mon...
    ...and veers into a bathroom.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    No, no...!

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Janitor cleans the sinks. Woody sneaks into a nearby 
stall. Looks up, sees an open window. 

He tears a square of toilet paper, places it on the seat, 
climbs up the tank lid, leaps to the toilet paper roll, 
jumps to the top of the stall, backs toward the window.

At the sink, the Janitor looks in the mirror, starts.

        JANITOR 
    What the heck?

Woody freezes. The Janitor stares at the mirror, Woody in 
its reflection.

RACK FOCUS -- The Janitor reaches up, wipes a stain off.

        JANITOR (CONT’D)
    That’s better.

RACK BACK -- The window in the mirror. Woody’s gone.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
Woody finds himself above the playground. Below, Bonnie 
plays hopscotch by herself. Her Mom walks over.

        BONNIE’S MOM
    Bonnie...? There you are. C’mon, 
    honey. Time to go home. 

She leads Bonnie off. Woody climbs up a drainage pipe to 
the roof. He runs across the roof, stops at the edge.

POV, PANNING -- A high wall surrounds the day care campus. 

Woody frowns. A gust lifts his hat off, blows it away. 

        WOODY
    Oh, no! No, no, no...!

            44

His hat lands under a kite tangled on the roof top. Woody 
stares at the kite -- an idea.

CUT TO:

Woody runs across the roof, kite over his head. He leaps 
and soars across the playground and over the wall. He 
glides down, makes a perfect landing, and laughs, pleased. 

Abruptly, another gust hits, yanking him high in the air. 

Woody looks at the ground far below. The wind takes the 
kite higher still, dipping and swirling frenetically.

Woody panics, wrapping himself around the kite’s cross-bar. 
The bar snaps. The kite plummets. Woody tries desperately 
to flap the kite wings, but it doesn’t slow his fall.

He crashes into a tree, hitting branches on the way down. 
He falls from the tree and stops -- eyes shut -- inches 
above the pavement. Opens one eye.

Slowly, his pull-string lifts him upward.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    (voice box)
    Reach for the sky!

Woody dangles from a branch, trying to free himself. 

Bonnie approaches, playing hopscotch. Woody sees her, goes 
limp. She bumps into Woody, looks up. Looks around. She 
tugs Woody off the branch. His pull-string retracts.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    (voice box)
    You’re my favorite deputy!

She smiles. HONK HONK!

        BONNIE’S MOM (O.S.)
    Bonnie! 

        BONNIE
    Coming!

She shoves Woody in her backpack, zips it up, runs off. 

IN THE BACKPACK

Woody is trapped. 

        WOODY
    Oh, great!

            45

As Bonnie and her Mom drive off, CRANE DOWN to REVEAL... 
Woody’s hat, lying on the ground. 

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY

Bullseye whimpers, stares at the door. Jessie consoles him.

        JESSIE
    Oh, it’s gonna be okay, Bullseye.

        BUZZ
    Woody’s going to college with Andy. 
    It’s what he’s always wanted.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    He’s crazy! College is no place for 
    a toy!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Toys are for play time!

        HAMM
    Speaking of play time...! They’re 
    lining up out there!

Hamm, at the window, is spying on the playground. 

        BUZZ
    How many?

        HAMM
    There must be dozens!

        REX
    Ohhh...! I can hardly wait!

        BUZZ
    Places, everyone!

The Toys scramble into play position. 

Buzz notices the Day Care Toys edging away from the door -- 
ducking, hiding, trembling, diving for cover. 

The bell RINGS. Kids SHRIEK. Footsteps THUNDER.

Rex spreads his arms and runs to the playground door.

        REX
    At last! I’m gonna get played with!

        BUZZ
    Uh, Rex...?

            46

        REX
    Come to Papa!

BOOM! The door bursts open, swatting Rex across the room. 

A horde of squealing, hyped-up TODDLERS enter. 

The Toys go limp. Buzz closes his helmet.

The toddlers descend on the Toys with SHRIEKS of delight. 

Toys are snatched up by eager, excited hands.

A Boy and Girl stretch Slinky until his coil goes haywire. 

A Boy smashes the Toy Train into a wall. 

A Girl picks up Buzz, bringing him straight to her mouth.

A Girl dips Jessie’s hair in paint and uses her as a brush. 

A Boy runs across the room, with Bullseye on top of a Corn 
Popper toy. Bullseye slides off, gets caught in its wheels.

Hamm is bathed in glue... Then coated in green glitter. 

A Girl “rides” Rex, snapping his tail off. 

The Aliens are squashed as a Boy sits on them.

A Boy picks up Mr. Potato Head’s eye, shoves it up his nose. 

A Girl uses Buzz to hammer a square peg into a round hole.

BUZZ POV -- Buzz smashes the peg. Bam, Bam, Bam! 

A Boy runs by, tugs the Girl’s hair. She screams, tosses 
Buzz away. He lands on the window sill. 

BUZZ POV -- Across the playgound, in the Butterfly Room, a 
class of Four- and Five-Year-Olds play lovingly with Lotso 
and the other toys.

Buzz frowns -- Why is it Heaven in there and Hell in here? 

Abruptly, a HAND grabs him, pulls him back into the fray.

CUT TO:

        WOODY
    (voicebox)
    There’s a snake in my boot!

            47

INT. BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON -- Woody. His string is pulled again.

        WOODY
    (voicebox)
    I’d like to join your posse, boys, 
    but first I’m gonna sing a little 
    song.

Bonnie holds Woody, smiles.

        BONNIE
    A sheriff..!! Move over, Mr. 
    Pricklepants! We have a guest!

She plunks Woody at a small table circled by other toys -- 
a HEDGEHOG, a UNICORN, and a TRICERATOPS. 

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    You want some coffee?

She sets out cups, pretends to pour.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    It’s good for you! But don’t drink 
    too much or you’ll hafta... Hafta...

She dances from foot to foot.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    Be right back...!

She runs out the door. Woody comes alive, looks around. 
The other Toys stay frozen.

        WOODY 
    Psst! Hey! Hello! Hi -- Excuse me! 

The Hedgehog, MR. PRICKLEPANTS, comes alive briefly.

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS 
    Shhh!

        WOODY
    Can you tell me where I am?

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Shhhhhh!!!

        UNICORN
    The guy’s just askin’ a question!

            48

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Well, excuse me, I’m trying to stay 
    in character!

He freezes again. The Unicorn, friendly, turns to Woody.

        UNICORN
    My name’s Buttercup. 

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Shhhh!!!!

        TRICERATOPS
    I’m Trixie!

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Shhhhh!!!!

        TRIXIE
    Shhhhhh!!!!!

        BOTH
    Shhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

        WOODY
    Guys, hey! I don’t know where I am!

        TRIXIE
    We’re either in a cafe in Paris, or a 
    coffee shop in New Jersey. I’m 
    pretty sure I just came back from the 
    doctor with life-changing news!

Woody is baffled.

        BUTTERCUP
    We do a lot of improv here. Just stay 
    loose, have fun, you’ll be fine.

        WOODY
    No, no, no, I...

A FLUSH. Woody gets back in his pose. Bonnie runs in. 

        BONNIE
    Who wants lunch? Beep! Boop! Beep!

She pushes buttons on a toy microwave oven, opens the door, 
removes a plastic hamburger, plunks it in front of Woody.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    It has a secret ingredient...

She lifts the top bun...

            49

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    ...Jellybeans!

Bonnie eats a jellybean, pulls Woody’s string.

        WOODY
    (voicebox)
    Somebody’s poisoned the water hole!

        BONNIE
    Poison?!

She spits the jellybean -- it sticks to Pricklepants’s head.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    Who would do such a mean thing?!

She GASPS and becomes a different character.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    (as Witch)
    Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!! 

She turns. SMASH ZOOM to a DOLL on the shelf behind her. 

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    The scary witch!!

Bonnie picks up the Doll, flies it around the room.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    Look out! She’s using her witch 
    powers! 

CLOSE ON -- Woody.

        BONNIE (AS WOODY) (CONT'D)
    I know where to hide!

INT. BONNIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The toy box at the foot of Bonnie’s bed. It creaks open. 
Bonnie peeks out, grabs a Totoro, pulls it closed again.

INT. TOY BOX - DAY

Bonnie and Woody huddle in the dark.

        BONNIE
    She’ll never find us in here!

Bonnie surreptitiously lifts the Doll into view.

            50

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    What’s wrong...?

She turns. Sees the doll, SCREAMS.

INT. BONNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

The toy box tips over, spilling Bonnie and her Toys. 

        BONNIE 
    She found us! We need a spaceship to 
    get away!

She runs off into a closet. The Toys come alive.

        TRIXIE
    You’re doin’ great!

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Are you classically trained?

        WOODY
    Look, I just need to know how to get 
    outta here...!

        BUTTERCUP
    There IS NO WAY OUT!!!

Woody is stunned.

        BUTTERCUP (CONT'D)
    Just kidding. Door’s right over 
    there.

The Doll gets up, greets Woody.

        DOLL
    Well, Cowboy, you just jumped right 
    in, didn’t ya? I’m Dolly.

        WOODY
    ...Uh, Woody.

They shake.

        DOLLY
    “Woody”? Really? You’re gonna stick 
    with that? ‘Cuz now’s your chance to 
    change it -- new room and all. That’s 
    coming from a doll named “Dolly”. 

A PEA POD TOY zips open behind Woody. He turns.

            51

        PEA #1
    Who’s the new guy?

        PEA #2
    Are you a real cowboy?

        WOODY
    Well, actually, I....

        PEA #3
    ‘Course he’s not, pea-brain! He 
    don’t even have a hat!

        WOODY
    I do too have a... My hat?!

        PEA #3
    Told ‘ya!

        BONNIE (O.S.)
    I found the spaceship!!

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Show time!

Woody and the Toys go lifeless as Bonnie runs out of the 
closet with makeshift shoebox rocket. 

        BONNIE (AS WOODY) 
    Quick! Fasten your seatbelts! Close 
    your tray tables!

She stuffs the toys in the box, drops it on a bedsheet.

        BONNIE (CONT’D)
    Hold on, it might get a little bumpy! 
    3... 2... 1...! BLAST-OFF!!

She pulls the sheet taut. The Toys fly into the air.

SLOW MOTION -- Woody soaring. The moment is magical.

Woody and the others tumble onto the bed. Bonnie flops 
down with them, hugging them close.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    Yeee-haaaaw!!! You saved us, cowboy! 
    You’re our hero!!!

She pulls Woody to her cheek -- just like Andy once did. 
Woody glances at the other Toys. They smile at him. 

He smiles back. That was great.

            52

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - DUSK

The Toys come to life, groaning. 

        SLINKY
    Oh, I’ve got a kink in my slink.

Rex staggers by, tail missing.

        REX 
    My tail...! Where’s my tail?!

Buzz sits up, dazed. 

Hamm pulls his cork. Detritus spills out. He strains. 
POP -- a Weeble pops out. Hamm picks up a plastic arm.

        HAMM
    Someone need a hand?

He tosses it to Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head -- their parts 
completely jumbled.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Where’s my nose... Here’s 
    your arm... Honey, the 
    moustache...?

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Here it is... Gimme that, 
    that’s mine...

Buzz straightens up -- back CRACKING.

        BUZZ
    I don’t recall play time being quite 
    that strenuous. 

Rex pulls his tail from a peg board.

        REX
    Andy never played with us like that!

Jessie peels a decal off Bullseye’s nose.

        JESSIE
    We have to make the best of it.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    But these toddlers! They don’t know 
    how to play with us!

        REX
    They’re too young!

        HAMM
    They’re sticky!

            53

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    We should be in the Butterfly Room! 
    With the big kids!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    That’s right!

        HAMM
    You said it!

        BUZZ 
    We’ll get this straightened out -- 
    I’ll go talk to Lotso about moving 
    us to the other room.

He clambers up a table, leaps to the bathroom door knob. 
It doesn’t move. 

        BUZZ (CONT'D)
    Blast. Try that one!

Jessie leaps to the hallway door latch.

        JESSIE
    It’s locked!

At the playground door, Slinky tests the door knob.

        SLINKY
    Same here!

Buzz drops down, points.

        BUZZ
    Try the windows.

Hamm, on the sill, examines a window lock.

        HAMM
    Eh, negatory. It’s a Fenster-Schneckler 380. Finest childproof 
    lock in the world.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    We’re trapped!

        BUZZ
    Wait! Did anyone notice the transom?

        REX
    What’s a transom, Buzz?

Buzz looks up -- atop the hallway door is an open transom. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Oh, great! How do we get up there?!

Buzz narrows his eyes, thinking.

            54

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - LATER

The Toys hold a Fisher Price Corn Popper. Buzz, a loop of 
red yarn wrapped across his chest, stands at the rear.

        BUZZ
    All right, everyone! On three! 
    One... Two...

        JESSIE
    Three!!!

They take off, pushing the popper at top speed. 

        JESSIE (CONT'D)
    Let go!

The Toys drop away, leaving Buzz to jump onto the handle.

The popper strikes an upturned table, lofting Buzz in the 
air. He grabs a string that runs across the room, using it 
like a zip-line. As he reaches the end, Buzz leaps off, 
expands his wings and flies towards a display of hanging 
paper-mache caterpillars, using their legs to swing from 
one to another. On the ground, Hamm makes signal.

        HAMM
    Jump!

Bullseye and Rex jump off a shelf, catapulting a broom 
forward. Buzz bounces off the broom, towards the transom. 
He flips, twists, and lands -- safe. The Toys rejoice.

        REX
    He did it!!! 

        JESSIE
    Way to go, Buzz!

Buzz casts part of his yarn down to the Toys. They run and 
grab it. Buzz turns to the hallway, stops.

BUZZ POV -- In the hall below, a pair of tough Day Care 
Toys, TWITCH (Bug Man) and CHUNK (Rock Man) saunter past.

        CHUNK
    You think they had a fun playtime?

        TWITCH
    Shhh...!!! They might hear you!

Buzz frowns. O.S. GIGGLING. Buzz turns. Down the hall, 
Ken and Barbie say goodbye at the Butterfly Room door.

            55

        KEN
    Okay, now you start.

        BARBIE
    I...

        KEN
    ...love...

        BARBIE
    ...you.

        KEN
    See?! That time I said “love”. 
    Okay, now, me first.

CLOSE ON -- Buzz. He stifles a dry heave.

        BARBIE
    Okay, okay, okay....!

        KEN
    I...

        BARBIE
    ...love...

        KEN
    ...you! See what I mean? It changes 
    every time!

        BARBIE
    You are so smart!
    As the Tough Toys pass, they drag Ken away.

        TWITCH
    C’mon, Romeo... We’re late.

        BARBIE
    I’ll wait up for you!

        KEN
    Kisses...!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Buzz -- using the red yarn -- rappels down into the hall. 
He unties the yarn and steals off down the hallway. 

He reaches the Teacher’s Lounge, approaches cautiously. 

            56

INT. TEACHERS’ LOUNGE - NIGHT

Buzz peeks in. Ken, Twitch and Chunk approach a vending 
machine. Ken opens the bottom flap and they all go inside. 

Buzz frowns. He walks to the vending machine. Suddenly -- 
strangely -- a cow MOOOOS.

Buzz looks around, confused. Then he looks up.

Silhouetted in the top of a glowing vending machine are Ken 
and the rest of his Gang. A Rooster crows: COCKADOODLE-DOO!! This is followed by MUFFLED LAUGHS and HUBBUB.
Buzz approaches the machine. From inside come VOICES. 

        GANG (O.S.)
    Yeah, all right! Let’s go again!

Buzz pushes open the dispenser flap, climbs in. Above him, 
a pig OINKS loudly. More LAUGHS and GRIPES.

INT. VENDING MACHINE - NIGHT

Buzz climbs up rows of candy bars and potato chips. He 
gets to the top, sneaks towards the light. In the top of 
the vending machine, a Gang of toys sits around a table.

        KEN
    All right, place yer bets! Any 
    splits? Here we go! 

The Gang throws batteries, Monopoly money, other items into 
a pot. Stretch the Octopus pulls the cord on a Farmer Says 
toy. As the arrow spins, the Gang roots for their bets.

        GANG 
    C’mon, Duckie, Duckie! Big Pig! Big 
    Pig...! Turkey! Gimme the Turkey!!

Ken waves his hand over the table.

        KEN
    All right. No more bets.

The spinning arrow stops on “Duck”. 

        FARMER SAYS TOY
    Here is a duck: “Quack, quack”.

        STRETCH
    Yes! Yes! Come to Mama!

Stretch scoops up the pile of money. The others GROAN. 

            57

        KEN
    Stretch takes the round. 

The game continues, Ken presiding.

        KEN
    Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly. 
    Coyotes wild. Changing two double AA's.
    (as he changes money:)
    Hey, what do you guys think of the 
    new recruits? Any Keepers?

        SPARKS
    Nah, disposable...! 

        STRETCH (CONT'D)
    Landfill!

        KEN
    Cowgirl...? Dinosaur...? 

        TWITCH
    Toddler fodder! 

They start placing bets again.

        KEN 
    How ‘bout that Spaceguy? He could be 
    useful.

Buzz reacts, listening. 

        CHUNK
    He ain’t the sharpest knife in the... 
    place where they keep the knives.

        SPARKS
    Neither are you, Chunk.

LAUGHS. Twitch teases Ken.

        TWITCH
    You got a little Keeper yourself, 
    didn’t’cha, Ken?

        KEN
    Hey! Lay off, Twitch! Barbie’s 
    different!

        STRETCH
    Mr. Softy over here...!

        CHUNK
    Whaddaya expect from a girls toy?

    58

Ken stands, furious.

        KEN
    I’m not a girls toy! I’m not! Why 
    do you guys keep saying that?!!!

Twitch waves a hand.

        TWITCH
    All them Toys are disposable. We’ll 
    be lucky if they last us a week!

Buzz reacts. He turns to go... And bumps into Big Baby. 

Big Baby tosses Buzz on the table. The Gang quickly grabs 
and subdues him. Ken smirks. 

        KEN
    Well, well, looky who we have here.

        BUZZ
    Stop! Let me go!

He struggles. Ken narrows his eyes.

        KEN
    Take him to “The Library”.

        BUZZ
    Nooooooo!

A sock puppet is pulled over Buzz’s head.

            CUT TO:

INT. BONNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bonnie sleeps -- toys tucked next to her. Woody carefully 
slips from under the covers. Bonnie stirs, moves her arm. 
Woody freezes, leg in the air. She settles back to sleep. 

Woody tiptoes across the bed, looks around the room.

ZOOM IN -- Bonnie’s backpack, hanging from her door handle.

Woody pushes a chair to the door, climbs up, lifts a cape. 
The address on the backpack is revealed -- 1225 Sycamore. 

        WOODY
    1225 Sycamore!

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS (O.S.)
    Woody...! What’re you doing? 

            59

Woody turns. Bonnie’s Toys are watching from the bed.

        WOODY
    I... I gotta get out of here!

        TRIXIE
    You’re leaving?! 

        BUTTERCUP
    Didn’t you have fun today?

        WOODY
    Of course I did! More ‘n I’ve had in 
    years, but... Y’see, I belong to 
    someone else... 

He holds up his boot, where “ANDY” is written.

        BUTTERCUP
    Who’s “Yid-nah”?

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    I believe it’s pronounced “Yid-nay”.

        DOLLY
    Guys -- it says “Andy”!

        WOODY
    He’s my Bonnie...! And he’s leaving 
    soon. I gotta get home!

        PEA POD
    Where’s home?

        WOODY 
    Elm Street. 234 Elm. 
    (thinking)
    You guys have a map?

        DOLLY
    We’re on it, Cowboy. Trixie...?

Trixie giggles.

        TRIXIE
    I’ll fire up the computer!

INT. STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT

The sock is pulled off Buzz’s head. He’s tied to a toy 
chair in a closet lit with an overhead bulb. In shadows, 
Lotso’s Henchmen lurk. Buzz struggles to free himself.

            60 

        BUZZ
    Unhand me, you cowards! I demand to 
    talk to Lotso!

        KEN
    Zip it, Buck Rogers! You don’t talk 
    to Lotso ‘til we say you can...

Abruptly, the door opens. Lotso stands, astonished.

        LOTSO
    Ken...?! What’s going on here?! 
    Why’s this Toy tied up?

        KEN
    He... He got out, Lotso!

        LOTSO
    Got out? Oh, no, no, no! This isn’t 
    how we treat our guests! 

Lotso approaches Buzz, begins untying him.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    F.A.O. my Schwartz...! There you go. 
    I’m so sorry. 

He frees Buzz. Buzz stands, casting a dark look at Ken.

        BUZZ
    Lotso, there’s been a mistake. 

        LOTSO
    A mistake...?!!!

        BUZZ
    The children in the Caterpillar Room 
    are not age-appropriate for me and my 
    friends. We respectfully request a 
    transfer to the Butterfly Room.

        LOTSO
    (gestures grandly)
    Well, request granted!

        KEN 
    But, Lotso...

        LOTSO 
    Hush now, Kenneth! This Toy’s shown 
    initiative! Leadership! Why, I’d 
    say we found ourselves a Keeper! 
    (to others)
    Hear that, everyone?! We got a 
    Keeper!

            601

Lotso lifts Buzz’s arm -- World Champion! His Gang 
applauds dutifully. Lotso throws his arm around Buzz.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    We’re callin’ you up to the Big 
    Leagues, son! From now on, you’ll 
    have anything you want! 

        BUZZ
    Excellent! I’ll go get my friends.

Lotso stops. 

        LOTSO
    Whoa, whoa! Hold on there, Boss! 
    Those Caterpillar kids need someone
    to play with...!

        BUZZ
    But my friends don’t belong there!

        LOTSO 
    Oh, none of us do! I agree! Which is 
    why -- for the good of our community -- 
    we ask the newer toys, the stronger 
    ones, to take on the hardships the 
    rest of us can’t bear anymore.

Buzz frowns.

        BUZZ
    Well, I... I guess that makes sense.
    Lotso smiles.

        BUZZ
    But I can’t accept. We’re a family. 
    We stay together.

Lotso’s smile fades. 

        LOTSO
    Family man, eh? I understand. 
    (sharply)
    Put him back in the “Time Out” chair.

Big Baby grabs Buzz and slams him into the toy chair. 

        BUZZ
    What are you...? What?! Unhand me!

        LOTSO 
    Bring in The Bookworm.

            62

Ken whistles. A RUSTLING from a shelf above, where rows of 
files are cluttered.

        BOOKWORM (O.S.)
    Hold on... Here it is! 

An aged Toy -- The Bookworm -- pushes aside files.

        BOOKWORM
    It was filed under “Lightyear”.

He tosses a small booklet down to Lotso. Lotso opens the 
booklet, flips through it. Buzz looks close, reacts -- 
it’s a Buzz Lightyear Instruction Manual.

        LOTSO
    Let’s see here... Accessories... 
    Maintenance... Oh, here we go!
    (reading)
    “Remove screws to access battery 
    compartment...”

Big Baby pushes Buzz down, holding him while Sparks opens 
Buzz’s battery compartment. Screws drop to the floor.

        BUZZ
    What are you doing?! Let go of me!

        LOTSO 
    (reading)
    “To return your Buzz Lightyear Action 
    Figure to its original factory 
    settings, slide the switch from PLAY 
    to DEMO...”

Lotso looks up, nods. Twitch looks -- inside the panel is 
a MODE switch. He reaches for it. Buzz struggles.

        BUZZ
    Stop! No...! No...!!! NOOOOO!!! 

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

The Toys sit near the door. The echo of Buzz’s scream is 
heard. They turn.

        JESSIE
    What was that?

        HAMM
    Sounds like it came from the hall!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    I’ll see what it was!

            63

She marches to the door and plucks out her remaining eye. 
She holds it under the door, sweeping it back and forth.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mrs. Potato Head’s Eye, held by her hand, looks up and down 
the hallway.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

The Toys gather around her.

        JESSIE
    Whaddaya see? Anything...?

POV, PANNING -- The hall is dark and empty. Suddenly, a 
VISION of Andy in his room FADES IN over the dark hallway.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Nah, just a dark hallway and... 
    Wait, wait...! I see Andy!

The other Toys look at each other, disbelieving.

        JESSIE
    What?!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    That’s impossible...!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    No, I really see him! In his room! 
    (realizing)
    My other eye! The one I left behind! 

She concentrates fiercely. 

            TRANSITION TO:

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - NIGHT - POV

From under the bed, we SEE college boxes piled up by the 
open door. Andy crosses frame, carrying another box.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O)
    This is so weird...! He’s packing 
    up... Uh-oh. Oh, here comes Buster.

    Buster sniffs under the bed, right toward her eye.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.) 
    Outta the way! Get away! 

            64

Buster yawns, turns, and walks out of FRAME.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.)
    Okay, Andy’s in the hall. He’s 
    looking in the attic. Wait, there’s 
    Mom. Why is he so upset?

Andy gestures -- I left the Toys right here! Mom shrugs. 

Andy picks up a trash bag. Then Andy’s Mom remembers -- 
her hands fly to her face. Andy slaps his forehead. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.)
    Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

            TRANSITION BACK:

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Potato Head puts her eye back in, looks at the others. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    He’s looking for us! Andy’s looking 
    for us!

        JESSIE 
    He’s looking for us?!

        REX
    So, Andy does want us! I knew it! I 
    just knew it!!! 

Rex picks up an Alien, does a happy dance. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    I think he did mean to put us in the 
    attic!

        SLINKY
    Well, then Woody was telling the truth!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Holy cow!

        HAMM
    And you didn’t believe him!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Hey, you didn’t believe him first!

Jessie stands -- fire in her eyes.

        JESSIE
    Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

            65

CREAK -- A door opens. Light spills in. The Toys turn.
Lotso saunters in with his Gang. 

        JESSIE 
    Lotso...! 

        LOTSO
    How’re y’all doin’ this fine evening?

        JESSIE
    Oh, thank heavens! 

Jessie rushes to him. The others follow.

        JESSIE (CONT'D)
    Have you seen Buzz? 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    There’s been a mistake! We have to 
    go!

        LOTSO 
    Go?! Why, you just got here! In the 
    nick of time, too! We were runnin’ 
    low on volunteers for the Little 
    Ones! They just love new Toys, now 
    don’t they?

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Love?! We’ve been chewed! Kicked! 
    Drooled on!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Just look at my pocketbook! 

She holds up her chewed purse. Lotso bends down, amused.

        LOTSO 
    Well, here’s the thing, Sweet Potato 
    -- you ain’t leavin’ Sunnyside.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Sweet Potato?! Who do you think 
    you’re talking to? I have over 
    thirty accessories and I deserve more 
    respec--

Abruptly, Lotso yanks her mouth off. Everyone is shocked. 

        LOTSO
    Ahh...! That’s better!

Lotso’s Henchmen snicker. 

            66

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Hey! No one takes my wife’s mouth!!! 
    Except me! Give it back, you furry 
    air freshener!

He steps up to retrieve the mouth. Lotso holds it above 
him. He finally grabs it. Jessie heads for the door.

        JESSIE
    C’mon, guys -- we’re going home.

        LOTSO
    Whoa, Missy! You’re not going 
    anywhere.

        JESSIE
    (over her shoulder)
    Oh, yeah? And who’s gonna stop us?

Jessie almost collides with a blank-faced Buzz, stepping 
from the shadows. Jessie and the others are thrilled.

        REX
    Buzz! You’re back!

He runs -- arms open -- to greet him. Buzz makes a Kung-Fu 
sound, strikes a pose. 

        REX (CONT'D)
    Buzz...? 

WHAM!!! Buzz tackles Rex, slamming him to the floor. 

        JESSIE
    Hey!

Buzz leaps and kicks, spins the Toys around, and knocks 
their legs from under them. 

        SLINKY
    Buzz!

The Toys fall to the floor, stunned. Buzz stands atop 
them, salutes.

        BUZZ
    Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso!

        JESSIE
    Buzz? What are you doing...?

        BUZZ
    Silence, minions of Zurg! You’re in 
    the custody of the Galactic Alliance!

            67

        REX
    Zurg...?

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Galactic Alliance...?

        HAMM
    Huh-boy...!

        LOTSO
    Good work, Lightyear. Now lock ‘em up!

        BUZZ
    Yes, sir! 

JUMP CUTS -- Buzz and Lotso’s Gang herd the Toys into the 
room’s wire-mesh cubbies. 

Jessie fights back -- taking out Chunk and Sparks. Stretch 
grabs her from behind, puts her in a wire cubby, shuts it. 

        STRETCH
    Where do you think you’re going?!

Jessie reaches through the cubby wire to Buzz’s shoulder.

        JESSIE
    Buzz...?! We’re your friends!

He swats her hand away.

        BUZZ 
    Spare me your lies, Temptress! Your 
    Emperor is defeated. And I’m immune 
    to your... Bewitching good looks.

He turns, ramrod straight, and walks off. 

Big Baby lifts Mrs. Potato Head to a cubby. Mr. Potato 
Head intercedes.

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Hey, Mongo! Keep your paws off my 
    wife!

Big Baby drops Mrs. Potato Head in the cubby, turns and 
picks up Mr. Potato Head.

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    Hey, what are you doing? Let go of 
    me you drooling doofus!

Lotso steps in.

            68 

        LOTSO 
    Wait! I think this Potato needs to 
    learn himself some manners! Take him 
    to The Box. 

Big Baby hoists Potato Head up and toddles off. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Where’re you taking me? Put me down, 
    you moron! Bad baby! Bad baby!!!

They toddle past Barbie as she enters the room, confused.

        BARBIE 
    Ken...?! What’s going on?!

        KEN
    Barbie...! I told you to wait in 
    the Dream House!

Ken puts an arm around her, leading her out.

        BARBIE
    What’re you doing to my friends?

Barbie looks over her shoulder as Sparks the Robot tosses 
an Alien into a cubby. Twitch slams it shut. 

        BARBIE (CONT'D)
    Hmmph!

She slaps Ken’s arm away and turns to join the Toys in 
solidarity. Ken tries to grab her.

        KEN 
    Wait, Barbie! 

        BARBIE 
    Don’t touch me! We’re through!

She stalks off. Ken is devastated. Then Barbie turns, 
walks back to him. He smiles.

        BARBIE (CONT'D)
    And gimme my scarf back!

She yanks the ascot off his neck.

        KEN
    Oww!

Barbie is slammed into a cubby. Lotso surveys the room.

            69

        LOTSO
    Lightyear! Explain our overnight 
    accommodations.

        BUZZ
    Yes, sir!
    
Buzz strides past the Toys, each trapped in a cubby.

        BUZZ (CONT'D)
    Prisoners sleep in their cells! Any 
    Prisoner caught outside their cell 
    spends the night in The Box! 

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Potato Head is carried to a covered sandbox. Big Baby 
lifts the sandbox cover, tosses Potato Head in. Potato 
Head reaches out, begging for mercy...

        BUZZ (O.S.)
    Roll call at dusk and dawn! Any 
    Prisoner misses roll call spends the 
    night in The Box!

...Big Baby lowers the lid, closing into BLACKNESS.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Buzz rattles off the rules. Jessie grows impatient.

        BUZZ
    Prisoners do not speak unless spoken 
    to! Any Prisoner talks back spends 
    the night... 

        JESSIE
    ...In The Box. We get it. 

Buzz whips around. Lotso puts a calming hand on him.

        LOTSO
    At ease, soldier! They’re 
    neutralized! But remember: They’ll 
    say anything to make you doubt 
    yourself!

        BUZZ
    Don’t worry, Commander! Any doubt I 
    had got pounded out of me at the 
    Academy!

Lotso climbs on a podium of ABC blocks -- jovial, relaxed.

            70
	
        LOTSO 
    Listen up, folks! We got a way of 
    doing things here at Sunnyside! If 
    you start at the bottom, pay your 
    dues... Life here can be a dream 
    come true! But if you break our 
    rules, step outta line, try to check 
    out early? Well... You’re just 
    hurtin’ yourselves.

He takes out Woody’s hat, tosses it. It slides across the 
floor to Jessie’s cubby. The Toys gasp in horror. 

        JESSIE
    Woody...! 
    (to Lotso)
    What’d you do to him?!

Lotso sits back in his truck bed, taps his cane.

        LOTSO 
    Y’all get a good night’s rest! You 
    got a full day of play time tomorrow. 

Lotso chuckles as he and his cronies drive off. Buzz 
remains behind, standing guard over the “cell block”.

The Toys grasp the bars of their cubbies -- the horrible 
truth of their situation hitting home.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON -- A computer keyboard. Woody types an address.

        WOODY
    1-2-2-5... Sy--ca--more...

BLOOP -- Suddenly, an IM WINDOW pops up on the SCREEN.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Who’s “VelociSTAR237”?

Trixie pushes in.

        TRIXIE
    Oh...! That’s just a dinosaur toy 
    down the street. That’s nothing. 
    Lemme just take care of that! 
    (beat)
    Just a dinosaur...!

Woody finishes typing.

            71

        WOODY
    All right. Sy--ca--more... Okay, 
    “Enter”!

Trixie hits the Return. Slowly, a map begins to assemble. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Please don’t be far! Please!

The map resolves itself. The route to Andy’s house is a 
short “Z” -- less than two blocks away. Woody is amazed.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Right around the corner...?! It’s 
    right around the corner!!!

Ecstatic, he hugs Bonnie’s toys, leaps off the desk, does a 
happy dance across the floor, strides to the kitchen door.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    I’m going to college! Look at me, 
    I’m big toy on campus! Hello! Hey! 
    I’ll see you at the Sock Hop!

        DOLLY
    Okay, Potsie!

Woody starts to slip through a pet door.

        WOODY 
    Oh, hey, listen -- if any of you guys 
    ever get to Sunnyside Day Care? You 
    tell ‘em Woody made it home!

Bonnie’s Toys gasp.

        DOLLY
    You came from Sunnyside?! 

        TRIXIE
    But... How’d you escape?!!!

        WOODY
    It wasn’t easy, I... What do you 
    mean “escape”?

Bonnie’s Toys trade glances. Pricklepants steps forward. 

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Sunnyside is a place of ruin and 
    despair, ruled by an evil bear who 
    smells of strawberries! 

        WOODY
    Lotso...?! 

            72

        BUTTERCUP
    He may seem plush and huggable on the 
    outside. But inside, he’s a monster!

        WOODY
    But... How do you know that? 

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Chuckles... He’ll tell you!

They turn -- with awe and respect -- to a toy clown, 
Chuckles, sitting on a sill, staring grimly out the window. 

Woody steps forward.

        CHUCKLES
    Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good 
    toy. A friend. Me and him, we had 
    the same kid -- Daisy... 

INT. DAISY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

A freckle-faced five-year-old, DAISY, unwraps a gift under 
a Christmas tree and finds a fresh, smiling Lotso inside. 

        CHUCKLES (V.O.)
    I was there when Lotso got unwrapped.

She hugs him -- love at first sight. 

        CHUCKLES (V.O.)
    Daisy loved us all, but Lotso... 
    Lotso was special.

INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACKS

QUICK CUTS: Daisy takes Lotso everywhere -- jumping through 
a lawn sprinkler; pushed on a swing; in bed while she reads 
to him, etc. He gazes lovingly at her.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.) 
    They did everything together. You 
    never seen a kid and a toy more in 
    love.

EXT. STATION WAGON - DAY - FLASHBACK

Daisy sits in the back of a station wagon, Lotso in her 
lap. Big Baby and Chuckles are buckled in beside them. 

        CHUCKLES (V.O.)
    One day, we took a drive...

            73

EXT. REST STOP - DAY - FLASHBACK

At a rest stop, Daisy’s Family has lunch in the grass while 
Daisy plays happily with Lotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.)
    Hit a rest stop, had a little play 
    time. 

Daisy’s Mom waves a sandwich. Daisy puts down the Toys and 
runs to join her family.

            DISSOLVE TO:

A sleeping Daisy is carried to the car.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

A seat belt is clicked around the sleeping Daisy. The car 
drives off.
Daisy’s Toys sit up, their worst fears come true.

            DISSOLVES:

Lotso peers down the road, keeping vigil as the sun sets. 
Days pass. Rain falls. The forgotten Toys remain.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    She never came back.

CLOSE -- A heart-shaped pendant reads, “My heart belongs 
to...” A child’s writing shows Daisy’s name and address.

Lotso reads the pendant, hung around Big Baby’s neck. He 
sets off across the fields. Chuckles and Big Baby follow.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    Lotso wouldn’t give up. It took 
    forever, but we finally made it back 
    to Daisy’s. 

EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - DUSK

Lotso, Chuckles and Big Baby stand in the bushes outside 
Daisy’s window -- muddy, worn. Big Baby boosts Lotso and 
Chuckles to the window sill. They peer in. Through the 
window, Daisy lies in her bed, reading a picture book.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.)
    But by then, it was too late.

FAST ZOOM -- Tucked beside her is a brand-new Lotso Bear.

            74

TRACK IN ON -- Lotso. His Universe is shattered. 
Lotso drops from the window. Rain begins to fall. 

        CHUCKLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    Something changed that day inside 
    Lotso. Something snapped... 

Lotso’s face hardens. Big Baby stares -- uncomprehending. 

        LOTSO
    She replaced us. C’mon!

He turns to go, but Big Baby and Chuckles stay put.

        YOUNG CHUCKLES
    No, she only replaced yo--!

Lotso turns on Chuckles.

        LOTSO
    She replaced all of us! Didn’t she?!

Chuckles shrinks back, cowed. Big Baby looks at the 
pendant, turns and begins climbing up towards Daisy’s 
window. Lotso walks back to Big Baby and yanks him down.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    She don’t love you no more! Now 
    come on!

He rips the pendant off, throws it away, and stalks off. 
Chuckles and Big Baby are left behind -- heart-broken.

EXT. TRUCK BUMPER - NIGHT

Lotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby hunch in the red, tail-lit 
glow of the bumper of a delivery truck as it drives through 
swirling rain. Their eyes are dead, hopeless.

        CHUCKLES (V.O.)
    We were lost. Cast off. Unloved. 
    Unwanted...

The truck hits a pothole, knocking them off the bumper. 
They hit the pavement, tumble into a puddle in front of...

EXT. SUNNYSIDE DAY CARE, FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

It’s dark. Rain pours. Lotso, Chuckles, and the Baby lift 
their faces from the puddle. 

A FLASH of lightning reveals the Sunnyside Day Care Center. 

            75

        CHUCKLES 
    Then we found Sunnyside. But Lotso 
    wasn’t my friend anymore...

Lotso stands, eyes narrowed. He limps towards the Day 
Care. Chuckles and Big Baby watch from the puddle. 
Lightning FLASHES.

            MATCH CUT:

INT. KITCHEN - DAWN

Chuckles, remembering. Woody listens, rapt. 

        CHUCKLES
    ...He wasn’t anyone’s friend. He 
    took over Sunnyside, rigged the whole 
    system.

He reaches in his pocket, pulls out Big Baby’s pendant. 

        WOODY
    So... How’d you get out?

        CHUCKLES
    I got broke. Bonnie found me, took 
    me home. Other Toys, they weren’t so 
    lucky.
    (voice quavers)
    It ain’t right, what Lotso done! New 
    toys -- they don’t stand a chance! 

Woody looks up.

        WOODY
    But... My friends are in there!

        BUTTERCUP
    You can’t go back! It’s too 
    dangerous!

        MR. PRICKLEPANTS
    Returning now would be suicide!

        DOLLY
    But what about your... “Andy”?

        TRIXIE
    Isn’t he leaving tomorrow?

TRACK IN ON -- Woody, torn. 

            76

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAWN

The room is still. A HARMONICA plays mournfully. 

TRACK down the cubbies -- The Toys grip the bars, forlorn. 

CRANE TO REVEAL Hamm, playing the harmonica. 

Suddenly, Buzz pounds on Hamm’s cubby.

        BUZZ
    Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

Hamm stops playing, sighs. Buzz moves off. Bullseye looks 
at Woody’s hat, whimpers sadly. Jessie pats his muzzle.

        JESSIE
    Oh, Bullseye... I miss Woody, too. 

She turns away, bows her head.

        JESSIE (CONT'D)
    But he ain’t ever comin’ back. 

Jessie lifts her boot, revealing “ANDY” written underneath. 
Her eyes fill with regret. 

The bathroom door bursts open. A Tonka truck races in the 
room -- Lotso in the back, his Gang hanging off the sides, 
WHOOPING it up. The truck comes screeching to a stop.

        LOTSO
    Rise and shine, Campers! 

Buzz snaps to attention, salutes.

        BUZZ
    Commander Lotso, Sir! All quiet! 
    Nothing to report!

        LOTSO 
    Excellent, Lightyear! C’mon -- we 
    need you back at Star Command!

Buzz hops in the back of the truck. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Wait! What you have you done with my 
    husband?!

        LOTSO
    Big Baby...?

Big Baby steps forward and tosses a dazed Mr. Potato Head 
into the room -- coughing, groaning, covered in sand. 

            77

The Toys gasp. Mrs. Potato Head reaches out.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    Sweetheart...!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    It was cold...! And dark...! 
    Nothing but sand and a couple of 
    Lincoln Logs...

        HAMM 
    I don’t think those weren’t Lincoln 
    Logs.

Lotso addresses the room.

        LOTSO 
    Y’all get ready -- you got a play-date with destiny!

	    CUT TO:

A BELL -- Ringing. 

Bonnie runs down the hall and enters the Butterfly Room.

INT. BUTTERFLY ROOM - DAY

The room thrums with the happy CHATTER of young kids. 
Bonnie drops off her backpack at the lockers, rushes off. 

STAY on her backpack. It unzips. Woody peers out, then 
surreptitiously scrambles to the top of a bookshelf. 

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - DAY

Woody pushes aside an acoustic panel, climbs in the crawl 
space above the tiles, and slides the panel back in place. 

O.S. -- Children’s SHRIEKS. Woody turns.

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE, CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY

Crawling, Woody follows the noise, puts his ear to a tile.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY

Woody pulls up the ceiling tile and drops onto an empty 
reading loft, furnished with pillows and bean bag chairs. 
He creeps to the edge of the loft and scans the room.

            78

POV -- Below, a Toddler uses Rex to hammer a bongo drum. 

Another Toddler holds a Potato Head in each hand, then 
smashes them to the ground. Their pieces scatter.

A child swings Jessie by her hair, releases her. Jessie 
slams into a wall, drops to the floor.

Woody is horrified. 

Then, off-screen, a toy-phone bell RINGS. 

Woody turns. A Fisher Price Phone, The Lifer, wheels into 
view. He RINGS again, drops his receiver, retreats into 
shadows. Woody creeps to the phone, lifts the receiver. 

        WOODY
    Uh... Hello...?

The Lifer’s voice is hoarse and grizzled. 

        LIFER
    You shouldn’a come back, Cowboy. 
    They cracked down hard since you 
    left. More guards. More patrols. 
    You and your friends ain’t ever 
    gettin’ outta here now.

        WOODY 
    I made it out once...

        LIFER 
    You got lucky once. Want my advice? 
    Keep your heads down. You’ll survive. 

        WOODY
    Yeah? For how long?

        LIFER
    (squints like Clint)
    I been here years. They’ll never 
    break me. There’s only one way Toys 
    leave this place...

The Lifer rolls forward. Through the window, the Janitor -- 
across the yard -- dumps the broken Toy Train into a trash 
chute. Woody shudders -- he’s just witnessed a Toy death. 

        LIFER (CONT'D)
    Poor fella. Trash truck comes at 
    dawn. Then it’s off to The Dump...

Woody bends down, respectful.

            79

        WOODY 
    I appreciate your concern, Old Timer. 
    But we have a kid waiting for us. 
    Now we’re leaving. If you’d help us 
    -- one toy to another -- I’d sure be 
    grateful.

The Lifer sighs.

        LIFER
    Well, if you’re gonna get out... 
    First thing you gotta get through’s 
    the doors.

SHOTS -- FAST TRACKING IN on knobs of the playground door; 
the hall door; the office door. Each door is shut and 
locked. Keys are left dangling on a hook in the office.

        LIFER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    ...Locked every night, inside and 
    out. Keys are left on a hook in the 
    office. 

        WOODY (V.O.)
    Got it. What else?

SHOTS -- Night. Toy Trucks patrol the empty halls of the 
Day Care. Outside, Trucks patrol the deserted playground.

        LIFER (V.O.)
    Lotso has trucks patrolling all night 
    long. Hallway. Lobby. Playground. 

        WOODY
    Yeah, yeah... What about the wall?

SHOTS -- TRACKING along the mural-covered cinder block wall. 

        LIFER (V.O.) 
    Eight feet high. Cinderblock. No 
    way through it. You go over or 
    under.

Woody frowns.

        WOODY
    That’s it?! Doesn’t seem so bad.

        LIFER
    It’s not. Your real problem’s The 
    Monkey.

            80

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

A TOY CHIMP sits at the console of security monitors.

        LIFER (V.O.) 
    The Monkey’s the Eye in the Sky...

CLOSE ON -- THE MONKEY’S EYES 

The bank of monitors is reflected in them.

        LIFER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
    He sees everything... 

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

A Toy Bunny slips through the bars of his cubby, scampers 
toward the hallway door.

        LIFER (V.O.)
    ...Classrooms...

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

The Monkey, staring at the security monitors, sees the 
Bunny on screen, bares his teeth and SCREECHES, presses the 
PA button, and begins furiously banging his cymbals.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

The Bunny -- busted -- freezes and looks around in a panic. 
The hall door opens and Lotso and his Gang step in. Big 
Baby lurches toward the Bunny menacingly.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A Patrol Truck passes down a dark hallway. A Toy Penguin, 
hidden, peeks out of a potted plant, jumps to the floor. 

        LIFER (V.O.)
    ...Hallways...

He waddles for the front door.

ZOOM UP to a security camera at the end of the hall.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

The Monkey sees the Penguin, hits the PA button, and begins 
SCREECHING and banging cymbals.

            81

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The Penguin is surrounded by Patrol Trucks. He puts his 
wings up. Big Baby pushes his way through the trucks, 
intent on meting out prompt and thorough justice.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

A trio of Plushies use a dart gun to fire a dart, tied with 
string, over the wall. They begin scaling the wall.

        LIFER
    ...Even the playground.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

The Monkey sees the Plushies, SCREECHES his alarm.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

A spotlight hits the Plushies. Within the spotlight rises 
the silhouette of Big Baby, arms lifted.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY

The Lifer lays it on the line for Woody.

        LIFER
    You can unlock doors, sneak past 
    guards, climb the wall... But if you 
    don’t take out that Monkey, you ain’t 
    goin’ nowhere. Y’wanna get outta 
    here? Get ridda that Monkey!

	    SMASH TO:

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - DAY
A bell RINGS. The Toddlers -- playing rough -- look up.

        TEACHER
    Okay! Recess! 

She opens the playground door. The Toddlers drop the Toys, 
rush outside. The Teacher hits the lights, closes the door. 

Jessie and the Toys sit up, groaning and aching.

        WOODY (O.S.)
    Pssst...! Pssst...! Hey, guys...!

            82

They look over. From a puppet theater, Woody waves. 

        JESSIE
    Woody? Woody!!!

        REX
    Woody!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    Thank goodness!

They quickly run and gather around him, rejoicing.

        SLINKY
    You’re alive!!!

        HAMM
    Hey, Buddy!

        WOODY 
    ‘Course I’m alive...!
    (sees Bullseye)
    Hey, my hat!!!

Woody takes his hat from Bullseye, puts it on.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Wait. Where’s Buzz?

        REX
    Lotso did something to him! 

        SLINKY
    He thinks he’s a Space Ranger again!

        WOODY
    Oh no...

        HAMM
    Oh yes. “Return of the Astro Nut!” 

        JESSIE 
    Oh, Woody, we were wrong to leave 
    Andy. I... I was wrong...

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Jessie’s right, Woody -- she was
    wrong!

        WOODY
    No, no. It’s my fault for leaving 
    you guys. From now on, we stick 
    together. 

The Toys smile, reassured.

            83

        SLINKY
    But... Andy’s leavin’ for college!

        JESSIE
    College!!! Hog-tie the mailman!!! 
    We gotta get you home before Andy 
    leaves tomorrow!

        HAMM
    Tomorrow...? But, that means...

        WOODY
    It means we’re busting outta here 
    tonight.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    What?! Impossible!

        REX
    But there’s no way outta here!

        WOODY
    No, there is one way out. One way...

He turns. 

RACK FOCUS -- Through the window is the trash chute on the 
maintenance shed. Woody turns to the Toys. They huddle.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Okay, here’s the plan...

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Ken, dapper in an evening robe, conducts his nightly roll 
call. He’s trailed by Buzz. Big Baby stands guard. 

        KEN
    Cowgirl...

        JESSIE
    Here.

        KEN
    Horse...

Bullseye WHINNIES.

        KEN (CONT'D)
    Piggy bank...

        HAMM
    Yo.

            84

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE, CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

From above, Woody watches through a ventilation grate.

        KEN
    Tyrannosaurus...

        REX
    Here.

        KEN
    Barbie...

        BARBIE
    Here...

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ken strolls on.

        KEN 
    Potato Head... Potato Head?

Silence. Buzz backs up, looks in the cubby. 

        BUZZ
    Hey! Tuberous Root Man! Wake up!

Buzz rattles the bars. An actual potato rolls to the front 
of the cubby -- a dummy potato, as it were. 

		BUZZ (CONT'D)
	Impossible!

A NOISE. Ken and Buzz turn. 

Potato Head is at the window, struggling with the locks. 

		BUZZ (CONT'D)
	Hey!

Potato Head sees he’s been spotted. He jumps off the sill 
and sprints to the bathroom door. 

Buzz and Ken run across the room. Big Baby toddles after 
them. As they EXIT FRAME we TILT UP to find...

Woody, in a hanging light, takes out a pipe cleaner, bends 
it, uses it to snag the clothing line of kids’ paintings.

Potato Head reaches the bathroom, bangs on the door, then 
turns to face Buzz, Ken, and Big Baby. They surround him. 

            85

INT. FRONT OFFICE - NIGHT

The Monkey, at the security console, sees Buzz and Ken 
corner Potato Head. He leans in to watch.

	    KEN
	Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato 
	Head?

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    That’s Mr. Potato Head to you, 
    Smoothie!

PAN and ZOOM past the distracted Monkey to another monitor. 
On it, Slinky slips out of his cubby cell.

        KEN (O.S.)
    You’re turning out to be quite the 
    trouble-maker, aren’t ya?

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Behind Ken and Buzz, Slinky runs to the middle of the room. 

        KEN (O.C.)
    What’d you think you were gonna do? 
    Waltz right outta here?

Woody grabs a bag of marbles, grasps the clothesline, jumps.

        MR. POTATO HEAD (O.C.)
    And I would’a got away with it too, 
    if it weren’t for you meddling Toys!

Woody lowers via the clothesline, drops the bag of marbles, 
grabs Slinky, and ascends back up to the ceiling. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    Ya ascot-wearin’ pink-noser! Mr. 
    Brains-Sold-Separately!!! 

He kicks Ken. Ken yelps, turns to Big Baby.

        KEN
    Take him back to The Box!

Big Baby grabs Potato Head, lifts him off the ground. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    No! Not The Box! I’m sorry! I 
    didn’t mean it! I like ascots! 
    Really! No... No! Noooooo!!!

They disappear through the bathroom door.

            86

INT. CEILING CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT
Woody and Slinky watch as Potato Head is dragged off. They 
close the ceiling panel. 

        WOODY
    Okay, check...

INT. CATERPILLAR CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Ken turns to Buzz.

        KEN
    Good work, Lightyear! Resume your, 
    uh... Space-guy... Thing-y!

        BUZZ
    Yes, sir, Well-Groomed Man!

He salutes, departs. Ken turns to go. 

        BARBIE (O.C.)
    Ken...?! Ken...!

Ken stops. Barbie waves to him. Ken looks around, then 
approaches warily. Barbie is tearful.

        KEN
    What do you want?

        BARBIE
    I can’t take it here, Ken! I want to 
    go to the Butterfly Room! With you!

        KEN
    Yeah, well, you should’a thought of 
    that yesterday.

        BARBIE
    I was wrong! I want to be with you, 
    Ken! In your Dream House! Take me 
    away from this! Take me away!

She breaks down sobbing. Ken is torn. Finally, he gives 
in -- no match for a woman’s tears. 

        KEN
    Darn it, Barbie...!

He moves closer, speaks low.

        KEN (CONT'D)
    Okay, but, things are complicated 
    around here. You gotta do what I say!

            87

        BARBIE
    (tears of gratitude)
    I will, Ken! I promise!

Satisfied -- and a little smug -- he pulls open the cubby.

INT. SANDBOX - NIGHT

Big Baby opens the lid of the Sand Box. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Wait! I’ll do anything...! I’ll 
    change your diapers!

Big Baby tosses Potato Head in, lowers the lid.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Big Baby turns and walks off. STAY ON the sand box.

TRACK IN to find a wood knot in the side of the box. 

It pops out, falls to the ground. Potato Head’s hand 
emerges, clutching his eye. It looks around.

One by one, Mr. Potato Head’s parts fly out the hole and 
land on the ground, next to the sandbox.

INT. FRONT OFFICE - NIGHT

The Monkey sits motionless, staring maniacally at the 
security monitors. The only sound is a TICKING clock. 

Woody, clutching a pouch, drops into FRAME behind the Monkey 
as Slinky, holding Woody’s ankles, lowers Woody head-first. 

Woody -- dangling -- begins swinging closer and closer to 
the Monkey. 

The Monkey frowns at a reflection in the monitor. 

The Monkey whips around, SCREECHING. Slinky slips. He and 
Woody land on the Monkey, knocking the mic to the ground. 

The Monkey HISSES, leaps off the desk, runs for the mic. 

Woody lunges for the Monkey, but misses. He grabs the 
microphone cord and whips it, tripping the Monkey.

Woody grabs the Monkey. The Monkey flips himself on top of 
Woody and starts crashing his cymbals against Woody’s head.

            88

        WOODY 
    Go... Get... The... Tape!!!

Slinky runs to a Scotch tape dispenser, grabs the tape with 
his teeth, heads back toward Woody. The Monkey turns, sees 
Slinky charging, tape in his mouth. He SCREECHES.

                CUT TO BLACK

INT. KEN’S DREAM HOUSE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - NIGHT

Ken and Barbie ride the Dream House elevator to the top 
floor. Ken opens the door.

        KEN
    And this... Is where the magic 
    happens.

FAST PULL BACK to REVEAL the living room of his Dream 
House. Racks of clothes line the walls. Barbie gasps.

        BARBIE
    Look at all your clothes!!! I can’t 
    believe you never brought me up here!

Barbie flips through the racks. Ken joins her.

        BARBIE (CONT'D)
    Tennis whites! Mission to Mars!

        KEN
    I know, I know! Check this out -- 
    “Kung-Fu Fighting”! “Campus Hero” 
    with matching sports pennant, huh?!

        BARBIE
    Flower Power...!!! Oh, Ken...!

Ken pivots away, his mood turning to melancholy reflection.

        KEN
    No one appreciates clothes here, 
    Barbie. 
        (then, bitter:)
    No one.

Barbie walks up behind him.

        BARBIE
    Ken... Would you model a few outfits 
    for me? Just a few?

Ken is stunned -- no one’s ever asked this of him. 
Throbbing DISCO begins. 

            89

FASHION MONTAGE -- QUICK CUTS

Ken emerges from behind a screen, sporting some of the most 
insane Ken outfits ever -- ‘90s, ‘80s, ‘70s, even 1960s -- 
with matching accessories.

Ken strikes just the right pose for each outfit -- slinging 
a jacket over his shoulder; doing “The Frug” in a fringe 
vest; polka-ing in Lederhosen; scuba moves; break dancing.

Barbie sits watching, enthralled. She laughs, claws her 
hand, growls like a cat. Finally, she applauds wildly.

Ken grins -- exceptionally pleased with himself.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

Woody and Slinky finish taping up the struggling Monkey. 
Slinky opens a desk drawer. Woody rolls the Monkey in. 
Slinky pushes it closed.

        SLINKY
    Go get the key!

Woody runs to a bulletin board above the desk. 

        WOODY
    Where is it...? Where is it...? 
    Where’s the key?

He finds the keys, buried under push-pinned papers.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Bingo!

Slinky toggles a security camera joystick.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Jessie sees the security camera panning back and forth. 
She turns, whispers.

        JESSIE 
    Yodel-Lay-Hee-Hoooooo...!!!

A few cubbies down, Hamm and Rex share a look. 

ANGLE -- Buzz, patrolling...

        HAMM (O.S.)
    Hey! Whadda you think you’re doin?!

Buzz stops, turns.

                90

In the cell, Hamm plugs his cork into his belly.

        HAMM
    I told you -- keep your hands off of 
    my stuff!

Rex raises his fists, trying to sound tough.

        REX 
    Make a move, Porky! 

Hamm jumps Rex. They grapple. Buzz runs over. 

        BUZZ
    Hey! No fighting! Break it up! 

He pulls the “cell” from the cubby and they tumble out. 

        HAMM
    Take that, Walnut-Brain! No wonder 
    you’re extinct!

Jessie and Bullseye steal out of their cubbies while Buzz 
gets between Hamm and Rex, holding them apart. 

        BUZZ 
    Hey, you can’t hit each other! 
    That’s my job!

        JESSIE (O.C.)
    Yoo-hoo!

Buzz looks up. Jessie and Bullseye stand on a bookcase 
above him, holding an empty, clear plastic toy bin. 

They leap, slamming the bin over Buzz. Hamm and Rex leap 
on top of it, pinning it to the floor. 

        BUZZ 
    (muffled)
    Help! Prison riot!

Buzz FIRES his laser in a circle at the side of the bin. 
He charges at the wall, hits it, and falls over.

Jessie turns to Bullseye.

        JESSIE
    Get the tortilla!

Bullseye heads to a locker, pulls out a lunch box. Jessie 
opens it. Inside is a tortilla. Jessie grabs it, dashes 
to the door, slides it under. She knocks and runs off.

            91

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

The tortilla lays outside. From the shadows, one of Potato 
Head’s arms appears, crawls over, grabs the tortilla, and 
drags it into the darkness. One by one, the parts implant 
themselves in the tortilla. The Tortilla stands unsteadily, 
looks around, blinks, then heads off across the playground. 

INT. KEN’S DREAM HOUSE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - NIGHT

Ken -- headband on -- is behind a shoji screen.

        KEN
    Ready?

        BARBIE (O.C.)
    Ready...!

Ken leaps from behind the screen in a Karate Gi and does a 
series of fighting moves, kicking and punching the air.

        KEN
    Haiii-Yaaa! Wah! Whaaa-aaa-aaa --

He freezes mid-pose. Barbie isn’t there.

        KEN (CONT'D)
    Uh... Barbie?

Barbie leaps out of nowhere, tackling Ken. Ken lands on 
his chest. Barbie grabs his head, spins it 180 degrees.

        BARBIE
    No more games, Ken. What did Lotso do 
    to Buzz, and how do we get him back? 

Ken is secretly thrilled to have Barbie straddling his 
chest, talking tough. He is defiant.

        KEN 
    You can’t make me talk! You can’t!

Barbie glares at him, eyes narrowing. 

Ken -- unable to contain his excitement -- blurts out:

        KEN (CONT'D)
    ...But I’d like to see you try!!!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

A Security truck patrols the hall. As it passes, the 
office door opens. Woody peers out.

            92

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

Slinky is poised with a key attached to a rubber-band sling 
shot. Slinky pulls it back. Woody signals “Go!”

Slinky releases the slingshot. It shoots the key under the 
door, across the hall and into the Caterpillar Room. 

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Jessie stops the key with her boot, picks it up.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Mr. Potato Head hoists himself up a tricycle and onto a 
classroom window ledge. He peers in.

Inside the Butterfly Room, Lotso is asleep. Potato Head 
turns and uses the trike’s mirror to catch a moonbeam. 

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Potato Head, on the sill by the door, sees the signal. 
She uses the key to unlock the door.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

The door opens. Jessie, Bullseye, Mrs. Potato Head and the 
Aliens slip outside. As a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past, they duck 
behind a traffic cone then creep off across the playground. 

INT. KEN’S DREAM HOUSE, BUTTERFLY ROOM - NIGHT

Ken is tied to a paddle-ball paddle by the ball’s string. 
He glowers as Barbie browses through his racks of clothing.

        BARBIE
    Let’s see -- Hawaiian surf trunks...

She holds them up, then RIPS them apart. Ken is horrified.

        KEN
    Barbie, those were vintage!
    (steels himself)
    It’s okay! Go ahead, rip ‘em! 
    They’re a dime a dozen!

        BARBIE 
    Oooohh! Glitter tux!

            93

RIPPPP...! She tosses the shreds at him. Ken groans in 
torment, but remains defiant.

        KEN
    Who cares?! Who cares?! Sequins are 
    tacky! 

Barbie picks up a Nehru jacket. Ken gasps in horror.

        BARBIE 
    Oooohh!! A Nehru jacket!

        KEN
    Barbie!!! Not the Nehru...!

        BARBIE
    This is from, what -- 1967? 

        KEN
    The Gruvvy Formal Collection, yes! 

        BARBIE
    What a shame...

        KEN
    Oh, no! No! No, no, no...!!!

Barbie pulls at the seams. A stitch POPS. Ken cracks.

        KEN (CONT'D)
    There’s an instruction manual! Lotso 
    switched Buzz to Demo Mode...!

He breaks down, sobbing. Barbie, steely, grabs Ken.

        BARBIE
    Where’s that manual?

INT. UTILITY CLOSET - NIGHT

A sleepy Bookworm pulls the Buzz Lightyear Manual from his 
stacks, hands it down to a waiting Figure in a SPACE SUIT.

        BOOKWORM
    I don’t know why this can’t wait til 
    morning, Ken, but... Here ya go!

The Figure salutes, turns, walks off. The Bookworm turns 
away, then hears an odd CLICKING. He turns back, stares. 

POV -- The Space-Suited Figure is wearing pink high heels.

The Bookworm rolls his eyes -- Ken! -- and turns away.

            94

INT. CLASSROOM CEILING CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT

        SLINKY
    What’s takin’ so doggone long?

A KNOCK. Woody slides the ceiling panel, revealing Barbie 
in the Space Suit, helmet off.

        WOODY
    So how do we fix Buzz?

Barbie grins, hoists up Buzz’s Instruction Manual.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Potato Head, on the ledge, sees Barbie pulled up into the 
ceiling. 

INT. CLASSROOM CEILING CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT

Woody gives Potato Head the “thumbs up”. Potato Head 
responds with complicated baseball-catcher gestures.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Potato Head turns and edges down the ledge. A FLUTTERING. 
He looks. His path is blocked by a Pigeon. A stare down.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    What’re you lookin’ at, Feathers?

The pigeon pecks him, taking a chunk out of his tortilla. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    Hey! Ow!

The pigeon pecks again. Potato Head slaps the pigeon. The 
pigeon grabs his forehead, dragging him down the ledge. 

Potato Head hits the pigeon with his hat, gives it a kick. 
The pigeon flies off. Potato Head shakes his fist.

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    Yeah, fly away, ya coward!

The tortilla rips and disintegrates.

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    Uh-oh...

In pieces, he drops off the ledge to the ground.

            95

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    Well, that’s just great!

A section of tortilla props itself up, looks around. It 
spots the classroom vegetable garden. The eye goes wide.

INT. CATERPILLAR ROOM - NIGHT

Buzz is still trapped in the bin, banging on the ceiling. 
Hamm and Rex have grown weary of his calls for help. 

        BUZZ
    (muffled)
    Help! Prison riot! 

        HAMM
    Give it up. No one can hear you.

        BUZZ
    (looking up, muffled)
    What...?

        HAMM
    I said no one can hear you!

        BUZZ
    (confused, muffled)
    What...?!!!

        REX
    (yelling)
    He said, “No one can...!!!”

        HAMM
    Shhhh...!!! Will you be quiet?!

He slaps a hand over Rex’s mouth. A NOISE. They look up. 
A ceiling tile opens. Woody, Slinky, and Barbie drop in.

        REX 
    Woody! You’re back!

Rex and Hamm move to the front of the bin. Buzz runs to 
the back and jumps -- knocking Hamm and Rex off the bin. 

Buzz makes a break for it -- running across the floor.

        WOODY
    Stop him! Don’t let him get out!

        BUZZ
    (into wrist radio)
    Star Command, I’ve been taken hostage 
    by my own prisoners!!! 

            96

Hamm and Rex tackle Buzz. Hamm, Rex, Woody and Slink keep 
Buzz pinned down, as Barbie rushes over with the manual.

        WOODY
    Quick, open his back! There’s a 
    switch! 

They pull open Buzz’s compartment, revealing the switch. 
Woody flips it. Buzz struggles. 

        BUZZ
    Unhand me, Zurg scum! The Galactic 
    courts will show you no mercy!

Woody flips the switch back and forth.

        WOODY
    It’s not working! Why’s it not 
    working? Where’s the manual?

Hamm flips through at top speed.

        HAMM
    Here we go! There should be a little 
    hole under the Switch!

        WOODY
    Little hole. Got it!

        HAMM
    (reading)
    “To reset your Buzz Lightyear, insert 
    paper clip....” 

        WOODY
    Rex, use your finger!

        REX
    Oh!

Rex sticks a finger in Buzz’s re-set hole.

        WOODY 
    Okay, now what?

        HAMM 
    All right, let’s see... “Caution: Do 
    not hold button for more than five 
    seconds.”

Abruptly, Buzz BEEPS loudly, falls limp, face plants. 

The others all look at Rex. Rex lifts his finger. 

            97

        REX 
    It’s not my fault!

Suddenly, Buzz leaps up, knocking the Toys off him. He 
strides forward, flips his wrist radio.

        SPANISH BUZZ 
    Bitácora Espacial -- Me he despertado 
    de hipersueño en un planeta extraño.
    (Star Log -- I’ve awakened from hyper-sleep on a strange planet.)

The Toys are speechless. Hamm glares at Rex.

        HAMM
    Now what did you do?!

        REX
    I did what you told me...!

Buzz -- hyper-alert -- glances sideways, narrows his eyes.

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Estoy rodeado por criaturas extrañas 
    y desconozco sus intenciónes!!!
    (I'm surrounded by alien creatures of 
    unknown intent!!!)

He whips around -- flamboyant Latin-style -- and trains his 
laser on Woody’s forehead.

        SPANISH BUZZ (CONT'D)
    ¿Quién anda ahí? ¿Amigo? O Enemigo?
    (Who goes there -- Friend? Or foe?)

        WOODY 
    Uh... Amigos! We’re all amigos!

Satisfied, Buzz struts forward, greeting them. 

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Me debo haber estrellado, y se me 
    borró la memoria. 
    (I must have crash landed and had my 
    memory erased.)

He approaches Woody, kisses both cheeks, strides off.

        SPANISH BUZZ (CONT'D)
    Han visto a mi nave espacial?
    (Anyone seen my spaceship?)

        WOODY 
    We gotta switch him back! 

            98

        SLINKY
    How do we do that?

        HAMM
    (re: manual)
    I dunno! That part’s in Spanish!

Patrol Truck lights pass by under the hall door. 

        WOODY
    We don’t have time for this! C’mon!

Woody grabs Buzz, hustles him toward the playground door. 

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Mi nave. ¿Lo encontraste? !Excelente!
    (My spaceship? You know where it is? 
    Excellent!)

They pass the Lifer, watching from the shadows.

        LIFER
    Good luck, Cowboy.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Jessie, Bullseye, and Mrs. Potato Head wait inside a 
concrete pipe. Spotlights survey the playground. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    (points)
    Here they come!

Woody, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, and Barbie steal across the 
playground. Spanish Buzz, trailing behind, does elaborate 
rear-guard defense poses. Woody has to grab him and pull 
him along. They duck into the pipe.

        JESSIE
    What took you so long?

        WOODY
    Things got complicated. Where’s 
    Potato Head?

        JESSIE
    We haven’t seen him!

Woody turns and peers out on the playground. Buzz, the 
last to arrive, sees Jessie. She turns to greet him.

        JESSIE (CONT'D)
    Buzz...

            99

Buzz is struck dumb. Time slows. His heart melts. He 
approaches, drops to his knees, takes Jessie’s hand.

        SPANISH BUZZ 
    Mi florecita del desierto...! Yo 
    nunca he visto la belleza verdadera 
    hasta esta noche!
    (My desert flower...! I have never 
    seen true beauty til this night!)

Jessie is speechless. She turns to the others.

        JESSIE
    Did you guys fix Buzz?

        HAMM
    Eh... Sort of.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Jessie, behind you! Someone’s coming!

The Toys turn. A tall figure looms. Mr. Cucumber Head 
steps into the light -- irked, agitated.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    You would not believe...! What I’ve 
    been through...! Tonight!

Mrs. Potato Head goes to him.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Darling...! Are you okay?

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    I feel fresh! Healthy! It’s 
    terrible!

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    You’ve lost weight! And so tall!

Bullseye nudges Potato Head’s torso toward him. 

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Ahhh, you’re a sight for detachable 
    eyes!

He plucks his eyes out and plants them on the spud.

            TIME CUT:

The Jungle Gym slide. A Patrol Truck drives by. Slinky 
slides down, pops out the bottom, looks both ways. 

At the top of the slide, Woody holds Slinky’s back end. 
The tail wags.

                100

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Okay, all clear!

ON THE PLAYGROUND

The Toys shoot out the bottom of the slide, scamper off. 
They huddle behind the spring of an animal rocking swing. 

        JESSIE
    Almost there!

Jessie darts out, with others close behind. The lights of 
a Patrol Truck approach.

        WOODY
    Back up, back up!

Woody backs into the shadows with Bullseye and the Aliens. 
The Truck pulls up and stops.

Jessie looks back, sees Woody and the others still hiding. 
Woody gestures “We’ll go around”. Jessie does a thumbs-up. 

Woody and the Aliens ride Bullseye across the playground 
swing set. They stop abruptly. Big Baby is sitting on the 
last swing, CREAKING back and forth, gazing up at the moon. 

Bullseye and Woody tip-toe behind Big Baby, approach the 
wood siding for the swing set area. Bullseye leaps over 
the siding but the last Alien falls to the ground. SQUEAK.

Big Baby swivels his head 180 degrees. 

Woody, Bullseye, et al lie low behind the siding plank -- 
in the shadows, amid plastic shovels and buckets. 

Big Baby dismounts, walks toward their hiding place. 

Woody looks around desperately.

Big Baby reaches the wood siding, looks over. 

No one’s there. Looks up and down. He walks off.

HOLD ON an overturned plastic bucket. Woody and Bullseye 
peek out from underneath, share a relieved look.

Jessie, watching from the bushes, sighs with relief. 

Abruptly, Spanish Buzz grabs her, yanks her to him. As 
Jessie stands awkwardly, Spanish Buzz performs a solemn, 
impassioned courtship dance around her.

Finally, Spanish Buzz takes Jessie in his arms. 

            101

        SPANISH BUZZ (CONT'D)
    ¡Ven conmigo! ¡Te mostraré las 
    maravillas de la galaxia, y juntos 
    lucharemos contra el despiadado Zurg!
    (Come with me! I will show you the 
    wonders of the galaxy, and together 
    we will fight the evil Zurg!)

He plucks a dandelion, offers it to her. 

At that moment, Woody pushes through the bushes -- safe. 
Jessie leaves Buzz, runs and gives Woody an impulsive hug.

        JESSIE
    Woody! Thank goodness!

        WOODY 
    C’mon! We’re almost there!

He and Jessie leads the Toys off, REVEALING Spanish Buzz -- 
stunned and heartbroken. He throws down his dandelion.

        SPANISH BUZZ
    El Vaquero...!!!

Mad with jealousy, he narrows his eyes and runs after them.

EXT. TRASH CHUTE - NIGHT

Woody leads the Toys to the trash chute. He jumps -- 
trying to grab the handle -- but can’t quite reach it. 

        WOODY
    Buzz, c’mere, gimme a lift! 

Buzz, smoldering, steps forward, dramatically pushes Woody 
aside. With a lovelorn glance at Jessie, he hits a button.

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Buzz Lightyear al rescate!
    (Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!)

Buzz steps to the chute, jumps up in a series of crazy, 
acrobatic moves, and grabs the handle, pulling it down. 

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Abierto...!

        WOODY 
    Way to go, Buzz! C’mon, everyone!

The Toys boost each other up onto the trash chute lid. 

            102

INT. GARBAGE CHUTE - NIGHT

Woody climbs in the chute with the others and peers down. 
POV -- The grimy metal chute recedes into blackness. 

        JESSIE
    Is it safe?

        WOODY
    I guess I’ll find out...

Woody begins a controlled slide down -- feet first, hand 
bracing. He slips and it becomes an uncontrolled slide. 
He scrambles for traction, eases to a stop at the bottom. 
He gets up, stands at the edge of the slide’s precipice.

ANGLE -- An alley. The trash chute cantilevers over a half-closed dumpster. Above him, stars twinkle -- freedom.

        JESSIE (O.S.)
    Woody...! You okay?

        WOODY
    Come on down. But not all at once.

        MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)
    What’d he say?

        HAMM (O.S.)
    I think he said, “All at once”.

NOISES. 

        WOODY 
    No...! No! No! No! No! 

Too late. The Toys slide down together. 

        TOYS
    Whoa! Watch out!

        REX
    Geronimo...!!!

They collide with Woody. Woody windmills his arms at the 
edge of the chute. Jessie grabs him, pulls him to safety. 

        WOODY
    Thanks, Jess.

Spanish Buzz looks about, confused and deeply disappointed.

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Donde esta mi nave...?! 
    (Where’s my spaceship...?!)

        WOODY
    Slink...? Think you can make it?

        103

        SLINKY
    I might be old, but I still got a 
    spring in my step.

He backs up, then leaps over the open pit to the closed lid 
of the dumpster. He lands hard, clutches a metal handle. 

        REX
    He did it!

        HAMM
    All right, Slinky-kins!

        SLINKY
    Okay! Climb across!

Suddenly, two pink paws step in front of Slinky. He looks 
up. Lotso looms over him, grinning. 

        LOTSO
    You lost, li’l doggy...?

Lotso kicks Slinky’s paws. He retracts, falling from the 
lid. The Toys pull him to safety. 

Behind Lotso, his Gang hops off a wall and joins him on the 
dumpster lid. Lotso notices Woody among the others.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Well, well...! Look who’s back!

A NOISE. The Toys turn. Lotso’s henchman -- Stretch, the 
Octopus -- clambers down the chute, blocking an escape. 

The Lifer Phone wheels into view -- wheels wobbling, one 
eye broken, frayed phone dangling. His voice is hoarse.

        LIFER
    (via handset)
    I’m sorry, Cowboy! They broke me...!

Lotso turns to the Toys, as cheerful as ever. 

        LOTSO 
    (incredulous)
    What are you doin’?! Runnin’ back to 
    your kid? He don’ want you no more!

        WOODY
    That’s a lie!

        LOTSO
    Is it? Tell me this, Sheriff -- if 
    your kid loves you so much, why is he 
    leavin’?

            104

CLOSE ON -- Woody, fuming. He has no answer. 

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Y’think you’re special, Cowboy? 
    You’re a piece of plastic! You were 
    made to be thrown away!

VROOM! A garbage truck turns into the far end of the alley 
and RUMBLES toward them. Lotso turns.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Speak of the devil...!
    (turns back)
    Now we need toys in our Caterpillar 
    Room. And you need to avoid that 
    truck. Why don’t you come on back, 
    join our family again? 

He smiles. Woody seethes -- at a loss for words. Jessie 
steps past him, eyes burning. 

        JESSIE 
    This isn’t a family, it’s a prison! 
    You’re a liar and a bully and I’d 
    rather rot in this dumpster than join 
    any family of yours! 

Barbie steps forward.

        BARBIE
    Jessie’s right! Authority should 
    derive from the consent of the 
    governed! Not from the threat of 
    force!

Hamm and Potato Head share a glance -- Huh? Lotso grins.

        LOTSO
    If that’s what you want...!

He bangs his cane. Stretch, the Octopus, begins to prod 
the Toys toward the precipice. Abruptly, Ken bursts from 
the shadows -- still in his underwear.

        KEN
    Barbie! Wait...! 

Everyone turns. He runs to Lotso.

        KEN (CONT'D)
    Don’t do this, Lotso...!

        LOTSO 
    She’s a Barbie doll, Ken! There’s a 
    hundred million just like her!

            105

        KEN
    Not to me there’s not!

He glances at her. She sighs. Lotso picks up Ken.

        LOTSO
    Fine! Why don’t you join her?!

He tosses Ken across the dumpster chasm. The Toys grab 
him, pull him to safety. Barbie hugs him. 

        BARBIE
    Oh, Ken! 

Ken stands and addresses Lotso’s Gang, earnest and heroic.

        KEN 
    Everyone! Listen! Sunnyside could 
    be cool and groovy if we treated each 
    other fair! 
    (points)
    It’s Lotso! He’s made us into a 
    pyramid and he put himself on top! 

Lotso’s Gang eyes each other. There’s a shift in sympathy 
but no one wants to stick their neck out. Lotso is amused.

        LOTSO
    Anyone concur with Ken?

No one moves. The truck RUMBLES closer -- two dumpsters 
away. Lotso turns to the Toys. His face hardens. 

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    I didn’t throw you away. Your kid did. 
    Ain’t one kid ever loved a toy, really! 
    Chew on that when you’re at the dump!

He turns away. Woody steps forward.

        WOODY
    Wait...! What about Daisy?

Lotso keeps a steely composure.

        LOTSO
    I don’t know what you’re talking 
    about.

        WOODY
    Daisy...? You used to do everything 
    with her!

        LOTSO
    Yeah -- then she threw us out!

            106

        WOODY
    No -- she lost you!

        LOTSO
    She replaced us!

        WOODY
    (pointing)
    She replaced you! And if you couldn’t 
    have her, no one could! You lied to 
    Big Baby and you been lying ever since!

Woody yanks something from his holster. It’s the rusty old 
pendant, “My Heart Belongs To: DAISY”. Lotso is stunned. 

        LOTSO 
    Where’d you get that...?!

        WOODY
    She loved you, Lotso... 

        LOTSO 
    She never loved me! 

        WOODY
    ...As much as any kid ever loved a 
    toy!

Woody throws the pendant. It lands at Big Baby’s feet. 

Big Baby stares, electrified, at the pendant -- a token of 
his long-lost love. He picks it up. His lip trembles.

        BIG BABY
    Mama...!

Lotso grabs the pendant. He pokes Big Baby like a bully.

        LOTSO 
    What -- you want your Mommy back? She 
    never loved you! Don’t be such a baby!

He throws it down and CRUSHES it with his cane. Big Baby’s 
face crumples. Lotso turns, yells at Stretch the Octopus. 

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Push ‘em in! All of ‘em! 
    (to his Gang)
    This is what happens when you dummies 
    try to think!

He shoves Big Baby. Big Baby shrinks back, hurt. 

Stretch advances on Woody and the Toys. They teeter at the 
edge of the precipice. Lotso faces them, sneering.

            107

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    We’re all just trash, waitin’ to be 
    thrown away! That’s all a toy is!

Abruptly, Lotso is lifted from behind by Big Baby.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Put me down! What’re you doing? 

Big Baby carries him to the edge of the dumpster.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    Help me! Help!

Around the dumpster, no one moves. Big Baby tosses Lotso 
into the dumpster. He lands in the shadows, looks up. 
With a CREAK, the Big Baby tugs at the open dumpster lid. 

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    No...! Wait...!

KLOON! Big Baby watches -- blank-eyed, pitiless -- as the 
lid SLAMS down, shutting Lotso in. No one can believe it. 

        REX
    He’s gone!!!

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Holy cow!!!

        BIG BABY
    Ah-pppbbblllmmmmmmm...!!!

He blows a RASPBERRY at Lotso. VROOOM! The Toys turn. 
The garbage truck is only 100 feet -- 15 seconds -- away.

        WOODY
    C’mon! Hurry!

The Toys hop on the now-closed dumpster lid, rush to the 
retaining wall, and help each other clamber onto it. 

A SQUEAK. Woody turns. At the crack between the two lids 
are the three Aliens. One Alien is stuck. He struggles 
while the other two stand around ineffectually. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Oh...! For crying out loud!

Woody glances at the approaching truck, then runs back.

        JESSIE
    Woody...!

Woody yanks the Alien free. Spanish Buzz gestures.

            108

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Vaquero, andale! 
    (Cowboy, hurry!)

The Aliens retreat to safety. Woody tries to follow, but a 
pink paw grabs his leg. Woody tries to free himself, but 
the paw drags him slowly into the dumpster’s depths. 

The Toys watch, horrified, as Woody disappears. 

The truck turns and approaches the dumpster, fork out.

        HAMM
    Oh, boy! Incoming!

BA-BOOM! The truck’s forks slide into the dumpster and 
begin lifting it up. As it rises past the retaining wall 
Jessie and Buzz fearlessly jump onto the rising dumpster. 

        JESSIE
    C’mon!

The other Toys follow. Barbie tries to follow too, but Ken 
holds her back.

        KEN
    Barbie, no...!

They all try to lift the dumpster lid. It won’t budge. 

The dumpster rises up, up, up -- and begins to tilt.

As the dumpster tilts, they start to lose their footing. 

As the dumpster nears vertical, the lid swings open and 
trash begins pouring into the truck. Woody calls out...

        WOODY
    Jess!

        JESSIE
    Woody!

Woody falls into darkness. A FLASH of pink goes by -- 
Lotso tumbles past. The dumpster LURCHES to a stop. 

All the Toys fall into the truck. 

Barbie -- on the wall -- reaches forward.

        BARBIE 
    No...!!!

She turns away, burying her head in Ken’s comforting arms.

            109

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT

The Toys find themselves in darkness, awash in garbage. 

        WOODY
    Can you hear me?! Is everyone okay?!!

        MR. POTATO HEAD 
    Of course not, you imbecile! We’re 
    doomed!

Buzz pulls himself from a mound of garbage. He GLOWS. 

        WOODY
    Everyone! Go to Buzz! C’mon!!!

The Toys begin wading toward Buzz.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The garbage truck rumbles through the streets.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT

The Toys congregate around Buzz. 

        WOODY
    We all here? Slinky...? Rex...?

The truck lurches to a stop. The hydraulic motor STARTS. 
Woody looks up. A dumpster appears above them, tilting.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Against the wall, everybody! Quick!

He leads the Toys to the front of the truck, seeking 
shelter. Buzz remains behind.

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Senorita! Senorita, donde estas...?! 
    (Miss...! Miss, where are you...?!)

        JESSIE (O.S.)
    Buzz...! 

He turns. Somewhere in the DARKNESS, her voice rings out. 
A trickle of garbage begins to sprinkle down from above.

        SPANISH BUZZ
    Senorita...!

Buzz runs through the falling trash until he finds her 
pressed against the far wall -- terrified. 

            110

CLUMP! Something large falls behind them. They look up. 

Garbage is falling out of the dumpster directly above them.

Buzz takes Jessie’s hand and they run across the garbage 
truck bay, dodging madly while trash rains down upon them.

Against the back wall, the Toys watch, aghast.

        HAMM
    They’ll never make it!

Buzz grabs Jessie and carries her -- dodging and weaving. 
A SCRAPING sound above. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    Look out!

Buzz and Jessie look up. An old TV set falls towards them. 
Buzz lunges and tosses Jessie out of the way. She turns. 

CRASH!!! The TV smashes down on Buzz. A deluge of trash 
piles on top, burying him completely.

        JESSIE
    Buzz...!!!

As the dumpster above recedes, Jessie runs forward and 
begins digging. The other Toys join her. 

        WOODY
    Anyone see him?!

        SLINKY
    Over here, y’all! I found him!

They rush over and drag Buzz from the pile. Buzz’s eyes 
are closed. Jessie pops his shield, shakes him.

        JESSIE
    Buzz, you okay?! Buzz! Buzz!!!

No response. Jessie shakes him again. And again. 

        JESSIE
    No...!

She hugs him, sobbing.

A BEEP. Buzz jack-knifes forward, then lurches back. 

Jessie pulls away. Buzz sits up, eyes open -- disoriented. 
He sniffs the air with distaste. Then he sees the others.

The Toys gape at him in open-mouthed wonder. 

            111

Buzz frowns.

        BUZZ
    That wasn’t me, was it?

        JESSIE
    Oh, Buzz! You’re back!!! You’re 
    back, you’re back, you’re back!!!

She throws her arms around him, hugs him tight. 

        BUZZ
    Yes, I’m back! 
    (beat)
    Where’ve I been?

        WOODY
    Beyond Infinity, Space Ranger!

        BUZZ
    Woody! 

Woody smiles -- partners again. Buzz looks around.

        BUZZ (CONT'D)
    But... Where are we now?!

        REX
    (excitable)
    In a garbage truck on the way to the 
    dump!

Buzz’s smile freezes.

EXT. TRI-COUNTY DUMP - NIGHT

The garbage truck drives in the entrance.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT

The truck grinds to a halt. The BEEP-BEEP-BEEP backing-up 
alarm begins to sound. The Toys look around.

        WOODY
    Everyone -- stay together! 

Everything lurches. The truck bay begins to tilt. 

EXT. DUMP - NIGHT

The garbage truck tilts up -- higher and higher. Trash 
begins pouring out the back, onto the dump below.

            112

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT

The back flap opens, allowing garbage to spill out. A 
trash pit is revealed below. The Toys begin sliding out.

        WOODY
    Hold on! We’re going in...!

        TOYS
    Whoa...!

EXT. DUMP - NIGHT

The garbage truck extends fully, tilting 70 degrees. The 
stream of garbage becomes a torrent.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT

The Toys cling together, screaming, as they slide out into 
the open night.

EXT. GARBAGE PIT - NIGHT

Woody lands on a trash heap -- Oooff! A plastic bag whips 
by. He sits up. He’s in a vast, wind-blown landfill. 

Nearby, Hamm and Rex unearth themselves. Mr. Potato Head 
helps Mrs. Potato Head up.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    You got all your pieces?

The Aliens pop up. One points to some heavy machinery -- 
with a giant claw -- in the distance.

        ALIEN
    The Cla-a-a-aw!

They toddle off toward it. 

        WOODY
    Hey! Guys, no...! No!!!

Suddenly, the trio of Aliens is bathed in headlights. 
Before anyone can react, a bulldozer passes over them... 

Just like that, they’re gone. 

        MRS. POTATO HEAD 
    My Babies...!!!

A blinding LIGHT pours over her and envelops the Toys.

            113

Woody turns. A bulldozer -- with giant, studded wheels and 
a massive grate -- is heading right at them. Rex SCREAMS.

The Toys are pushed backward toward a trench.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Hang on!

They tumble as the bulldozer pushes them over the edge.

EXT. CONVEYER BELT - NIGHT

The Toys land on a conveyor belt entering a dark tunnel. 

INT. CONVEYER BELT - NIGHT

Woody sits up and watches the light receding behind them. 
The other Toys gather round.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Woody! What do we do?

        WOODY
    We’ll be okay if we stay toge--...

VWOOSH! Slinky is pulled up OUT OF FRAME.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Slinky...!

        SLINKY
    Woody...!

Slinky is fixed to a fast-moving conveyor belt above them. 
Woody runs after him.

        WOODY 
    Slinky, get down from there!

A hammer shoots up and CLANKS on the belt, narrowly missing 
Slinky. All around them, other pieces of metal begin
FLYING UP and sticking to the ceiling belt. Jessie yells.

        JESSIE
    It’s a magnet! Watch out! 

High above, Slinky looks around.

        SLINKY
    Uh, you might wanna take a look at 
    this!

The Toys scramble up a pile of debris. 

            114

Ahead is a Shredder -- two fast-spinning vertical cylinders 
that shred everything on the belt. Buzz sees a lunch box 
near him starting to quiver....

        BUZZ
    Quick! Grab something metal!

He grabs it and is pulled up to the magnetic belt. Woody 
grabs a metal handle and flies up, sticking to the ceiling 
belt. Hamm dives into a nearby pot and is lifted upwards.

        HAMM
    You heard the guy...!

Each Toy grabs a metal object and lifts -- CLUNK! -- to the 
ceiling. Rex, the last, grabs an aluminum can, a CD, etc.

        REX
    It’s not working!!!

Finally, he grabs a metal fan and sails up to safety. 
Suddenly, a pink paw thrusts out from the belt below.

        LOTSO (O.S.)
    Help...! Help me!!! 

Woody turns. Lotso is pinned under a golf bag.

        LOTSO (CONT'D)
    I’m stuck! Help!!! Please! 

Woody looks at the approaching shredder. He lets go.

        JESSIE
    Woody...!

Woody lands on the belt, runs back to Lotso.

        LOTSO
    Thank you!

        WOODY
    Don’t thank me yet.

Woody struggles to lift the bag. Buzz drops down next to 
Woody. Jessie eyes the approaching shredder.

        JESSIE 
    Buzz...!!! Woody...?!!!

Woody and Buzz push together. They still can’t move it. 

Woody pulls out a golf club. The magnet tugs it upward. 
Buzz grabs it. Together, they pull it down and jam it 
under the bag for leverage. The bag finally lifts... 

            115

        WOODY
    Go! Go!

...and Lotso scrambles out.

Woody grabs Lotso. He and Buzz point the club skyward. 
They’re pulled up to safety as the golf bag is pulverized. 

Lotso looks back at the shredder, then at Woody.

        LOTSO
    Thank you, Sheriff...! 

        WOODY
    We’re all in this together.
    (turns)
    Right guys...?

All the Toys have vanished. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Guys?!

        JESSIE (O.S.)
    Woody! Down here!

Jessie and the others wave from a conveyer belt far below. 
Woody and Buzz let go and plummet.

EXT. DUMP / STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN - NIGHT

Woody, Buzz and Lotso land on the bed of a big, fast-moving 
conveyer belt with metal walls. The Toys gather around.

        JESSIE
    Woody!

The toothed belt begins to ascend upwards. 

        REX
    Woody! Look! I can see daylight! 
    We’re gonna be okay!

Rex points to a bright amber GLOW at the top of the belt. 
The toys scramble forward. Woody’s smile drops.

        WOODY
    I don’t think that’s daylight...

FAST TRACK -- At the end of the conveyer belt, garbage 
falls into a burning, churning vortex. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Run!!!

            116

Unable to jump off, the Toys begin running down the belt. 
They dodge, duck and hurdle over the coming trash, but 
they’re no match for the speed of the rising conveyor. 

Lotso trips, falls. A pulsing blue LIGHT. He looks up. 

High on the wall ahead is an Emergency Stop button. A 
ladder leads to the button. Lotso leaps up, grabs the 
bottom rung. He can’t pull himself up.

        LOTSO
    Sheriff...! The button! Help me!

The Toys look back, see Lotso. As they pass, Woody, Buzz 
and Jessie boost Lotso up.

        WOODY 
    Go!!! Go!!! Hit the button!

Lotso scrambles up the ladder toward the glowing button.

The Toys are carried up the conveyor belt toward the pit. 

The Toys watch Lotso -- receding -- as he climbs.

Lotso stays focussed on the button above him.

The Toys reach the belt’s acme -- heels at the edge of the 
waterfall of trash cascading to a melting, churning vortex.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Hurry!!!

Lotso reaches the walkway where the blue button glows. He 
turns and looks -- malevolent -- at the helpless Toys.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Just push it! Push it!

        BUZZ 
    Push it!!!

Lotso smirks, gives a salute.

        LOTSO 
    Where’s your kid now, Sheriff?!

He turns, runs off down the walkway.

        WOODY 
    No... No...! No...!!!

        BUZZ
    Lotso...!!!

            117

The Toys YELL as they tumble off the belt...

EXT. INCINERATOR HOPPER - NIGHT

The Toys land in a giant vortex of trash being sucked down 
into the glowing eye of an incinerator. 

It’s chaos -- trash tumbles over itself as sparks and ashes 
fly through the air. The ROAR is overwhelming.

Woody stands and starts trying to climb out. 

The Toys do the same, climbing desperately, fighting 
against the trash tumbling into the vortex of fire. 

They slip, fall, get up and slip again. It’s a nightmare -- 
no matter how fast they climb, they inexorably slide 
backwards. Rex slides past Woody, towards the incinerator.

        REX
    Ahhhhhh!

        WOODY
    Rex!!!

Woody grabs Rex’s hand, slides further toward the inferno. 

They are all being pulled inescapably downward.

There’s no way out. Jessie looks at Buzz.

        JESSIE
    Buzz...! What do we do?

Buzz looks at her. He reaches out, takes her hand.

Jessie grabs Bullseye’s hoof. Slinky takes Hamm’s hand. 

Hamm reaches out to Rex. The Potato Heads hold each other. 

Mr. Potato Head grabs Rex. 

Buzz reaches out to Woody... 

Woody takes Buzz’s hand, and the circle is complete.

As they approach the vortex, heat waves blast their faces.

The Toys close their eyes, turn away. 

Woody stares at the fire, shuts his eyes. 

This is the end.

            118

A LIGHT from above shines in Woody’s face. 

He opens his eyes. 

A giant mechanical Claw lowers towards them. 

The Claw plunges into the trash around them, closing them 
in its grip, then raises them up.

They soar into the air, away from the ROARING incinerator. 

Woody looks around in disbelief. 

The Claw spins, passing in front of the crane booth.

INT. CRANE OPERATOR’S BOOTH - NIGHT

In the booth, the Aliens man the joysticks.

        ALIENS
    The Clawwwww!!!

They lean into the joystick, steering the Claw to safety.

EXT. DUMP - DAWN

The Claw lowers and opens, dropping the Toys to earth. They 
spill out, COUGHING and GROANING like shipwreck survivors.

Woody sits up, looks around. Rex pops up through trash.

        REX
    Whew...!

They have faced death and survived, and are profoundly 
shaken. Potato Head stares at the sky.

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    Y’know all that bad stuff I said 
    about Andy’s attic? I take it all 
    back.

        SLINKY
    You’re darn tootin’!

        HAMM
    You said it!

Buzz and Jessie sit up, still holding hands. She looks at 
him, smiles. He smiles and holds her gaze. 

Mrs. Potato Head takes Mr. Potato Head’s hand.

            119

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Oh, darling! You were so brave! 

A SQUEAK. The Potato Heads turn, see the Aliens approach.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    You saved our lives...! 

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    And we... Are eternally grateful!

Potato Head scoops them into his arms for a big, proud hug.

        MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    My boys...!

        ALIENS
    Daaddddyyyy...!!!

Hamm looks around.

        HAMM
    Hey! Where’s that furball Lotso?

        SLINKY
    I’d like to loosen his stitching!

        WOODY
    Forget it, guys. He’s not worth it.

EXT. GARBAGE DUMP, ELSEWHERE - DAY

Lotso limps toward the dump exit. A NOISE. He turns, then 
drops, freezing.

A truck’s wheels SCREECH to a halt in front of Lotso. A 
door OPENS and SHUTS. FOOTSTEPS. A hand picks him up.

        GARBAGE MAN ONE (O.S.)
    Hey! 

        GARBAGE MAN TWO (O.S.)
    Whatcha got?

        GARBAGE MAN ONE (O.S.) 
    I had me one a these when I was a 
    kid!

He buries his nose in Lotso’s tummy, inhales.

        GARBAGE MAN ONE (CONT'D)
    (nostalgic rapture)
    Strawberries...!

            120

EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - DAY

The truck exits the dump -- Lotso strapped to the grill. 
He comes to life, panicked. On the grill are a couple of 
muddy, bug-spattered Plushies, including a sad-eyed FROG. 

        FROG
    Hey, buddy...!
    (Lotso turns)
    ...Y’might wanna keep yer mouth shut!

The others SNICKER. Lotso WHIMPERS. The truck RUMBLES off. 

ANGLE -- The truck passes, REVEALING the Toys, unaware of 
Lotso’s karmic comeuppance. Jessie sees Woody lagging.

        JESSIE
    C’mon, Woody -- we gotta get you home!

        BUZZ
    That’s right, “College Boy”! 

        WOODY
    But... What about you guys? Maybe 
    the attic’s not such a great idea.

He glances at them, uneasy. Jessie steps to him.

        JESSIE
    We’re Andy’s Toys, Woody...

        BUZZ
    We’ll be there for him. Together.

Woody smiles. 

        WOODY 
    I just hope he hasn’t left yet...

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Wait a minute! Wait, I’ll check!

She covers her good eye, concentrates.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
    He’s still packing...! 
    (GASPS)
    ...But he’s almost done!

        HAMM
    He lives halfway across town...! 

        REX
    We’ll never get there in time!

            121

The Toys glance at each other. Then, distantly, comes the 
air-guitar WAILING of Andy’s Neighborhood Garbage Man. 

The Toys turn, see him a dozen yards away. They brighten.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Andy’s loading up his hatchback with boxes. Molly’s on the 
lawn playing with Buster. As the garbage truck passes...

        MOLLY
    C’mere, boy. C’mon, Buster!

        MOM
    Is that it, honey? You got 
    everything?

        ANDY
    Yeah, just a few more boxes in my 
    room.

At the curb, REVEAL the Toys hiding behind a garbage can. 
Woody peeks around, gestures to the other Toys.

        WOODY
    Okay, c’mon!

INT. BACK YARD - DAY

TIGHT ON SPIGOT -- Woody’s hand comes in, turns it.

The Toys huddle while Woody hoses them off. Buzz closes 
his helmet. The Toys react to the cold water.

        TOYS
    Eeeaauggh...!!! Brrr...!!! Stop!!!

        HAMM
    That’s enough, that’s enough, that’s 
    enough!!

        WOODY 
    All right, go! Go, go!

The Toys run off. Potato Head pulls off his nose, blows 
out a spray of water.

EXT. GARAGE ROOF - DAY

Slinky heaves himself up to the edge of the garage roof. 
One by one, the Toys scurry up his Slink, then make their 
way along the roof towards Andy’s open window.

            122

INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY

Buzz and Woody peer in. 

        BUZZ
    All clear...!

They clamber through the window, jump to the floor. The 
other Toys follow, scrambling across the room. 

Mrs. Potato Head stops, puts a hand over her working eye.

            TRANSITION:

POV -- Under the bed, looking out. Mrs. Potato Head’s feet 
are in front of us, facing away.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD (V.O.)
    There you are...! 

The feet turn and a hand reaches TOWARD US, GRABBING the 
subjective eye.

            TRANSITION:

She pops her eye back in, blinks... And GIGGLES, tickled.

The Toys climb into a box marked “Attic”. Buzz helps them.

On the desk is a box marked “College”. Woody heads for it. 

He reaches the box, turns. This may be the last time he 
ever sees the other Toys. He scrambles back toward Buzz.

        WOODY
    Buzz...

Buzz turns. Woody offers a hand. They shake. 

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    This isn’t good-bye.

        SLINKY (O.S.)
    Hey, Woody...

Woody looks up. Slinky lowers a paw.

        SLINKY (CONT'D)
    ...Have fun at college!

        HAMM
    Yeah, but not too much fun!

Woody laughs, shakes hands with Slinky. 

            123
        REX
    Woody, take care of Andy.

        MRS. POTATO HEAD
    Yeah...

        MR. POTATO HEAD
    He’s a good kid. Tell him to get a 
    haircut.

        WOODY
    I will.

Woody sees Jessie.

        WOODY (CONT'D)
    Jessie -- you’ll be okay in the attic?

        JESSIE
    ‘Course I will. Besides... 
    (leans in)
    ...I know about Buzz’s “Spanish Mode”.

        BUZZ
    My what...?

He turns, confused. Woody and Jessie share a smile. 

        MOM (O.S.)
    Honey, you want some food for the 
    road?

        ANDY (O.S.)
    I’ll get something on the way.

Woody turns to Buzz -- there’s so much he wants to say. 
Buzz just smiles. 

        BUZZ
    You know where to find us, Cowboy.

Woody smiles. He turns, runs to the desk. 

Buzz climbs in the Attic box with the others. 

On the desk, Woody jumps on the edge of the College box, 
looks back at his friends. FOOTSTEPS climb the stairs.

Woody gives Buzz a salute. Buzz smiles, salutes back. 

Woody lowers into the College box. The Toys duck in the 
Attic box, pull the flaps shut just as Andy and Mom enter. 

        MOM 
    Did you say goodbye to Molly?

            124

        ANDY
    Mom, we’ve said goodbye like ten 
    times!

Mom stops, suddenly overwhelmed. The room is empty.

        MOM 
    Oh, Andy...!

Andy, beside her, is abashed.

        ANDY (O.C.)
    Mom...! It’s okay...

IN THE COLLEGE BOX

Woody quietly peeks out the hand holes.

POV -- Woody can half-see Mom hug Andy.

        MOM 
    I know, it’s just... I wish I could 
    always be with you.

        ANDY 
    You will be, Mom.

ON WOODY 

He turns and glances off, noticing something.

THE PHOTO 

Of young Andy, playing with Woody and the other Toys.

TRACK IN ON 

Woody. Mom and Andy’s words echo in his head. 

WOODY POV -- His GAZE SHIFTS from Andy-holding-Woody to 
Woody-with-the-other-Toys.

Suddenly, Woody half-smiles -- an epiphany. Sadness and 
uncertainty are replaced by happiness and determination.

FOOTSTEPS and collar JINGLES approach. Molly steps to the 
room’s threshold with Buster.

        MOLLY (O.C.)
    Hey... Aren’t you gonna say goodbye 
    to Buster?

Andy and Mom step into the hallway.

            125

        ANDY (O.S.)
    Of course I will...!
    (to Buster)
    Who’s a good doggie?! Who’s a good 
    doggie?!!! I’m gonna miss you! 

While Andy scratches Buster’s belly, Woody jumps out of the 
box, grabs a pen and a sticky note. He sneaks across the 
room, jumps on the Attic box, starts frantically writing.

Buster starts BARKING. Woody finishes writing, looks up.

        MOLLY (O.C.)
    He’s telling you to go already.

        MOM (O.C.)
    C’mon, get the rest of your things.

Woody gasps, looks up at the door.

TRACK IN -- THE DOOR 

Andy walks in. Mom and Molly stay in the hallway.

        ANDY
    Okay, Buster, don’t let Molly near my 
    stuff.

Andy turns, crouches to pick up the Attic box. 

He stops, noticing the yellow Post-It on the box top.

He opens the flaps, finding all of his Toys.

        ANDY (CONT'D)

    Hey...! 

He digs through them -- pulling a few out, making sure 
they’re all there -- smiling with fondness and relief. 

He picks up the Post-It, reads it. He calls out.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    Hey, Mom... So, you really think I 
    should donate these?

Mom answers from the hallway.

        MOM (O.S.)
    It’s up to you, honey. Whatever you 
    want to do.

            CUT TO:

            126

INT. CAR - DAY 

Andy cruises, looking for an address. A box with “Attic” 
crossed out sits in the passenger seat. The car slows.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Andy grabs the box and gets out.

TRACK IN -- The hand slot of the College box, left behind.

POV - COLLEGE BOX -- Andy crosses the street and approaches 
the house. 

Andy stops, glances at the box. On the Post-It is written: 

        DONATE TO: 
    Bonnie 
    1225 Sycamore Road

TILT UP -- The address on the front gate. It matches. 

Andy sees Bonnie playing in the front yard, while her Mom 
and Dad garden nearby.

        BONNIE 
    No! Don’t go in there! The bakery 
    is haunted...!!!
    (another voice:)
    Shhhhhh!!! Are you crazy?! You’ll 
    wake up all the ghosts!

Andy watches Bonnie play -- exuberant and unself-conscious. 

        BONNIE (CONT’D)
    Look out! The ghosts are throwing 
    pies! Splat! Splat! Splat!

Bonnie notices Andy and immediately stops playing.

        BONNIE (CONT'D)
    Mom...?

Bonnie’s Mom looks over, sees Andy. She stands.

        BONNIE’S MOM 
    Andy...! 

        ANDY
    Hi!

Andy lets himself in the gate. 

            127

        BONNIE’S MOM
    Wow! Look at you! I hear you’re off 
    to college?!

        ANDY
    Yeah. Right now, actually. 

        BONNIE’S MOM
    So, what can we do for you?

Bonnie goes and stands behind her Mom. 

        ANDY
    Uhh... I have some toys here.

        BONNIE’S MOM
    Ohhh...! You hear that, Bonnie?

Bonnie peeks around her Mom, curious.

        ANDY
    So you’re Bonnie?

He hunches down so he’s eye to eye with her. 

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    I’m Andy. Someone told me you’re 
    really good with toys. These are 
    mine, but I’m going away now, so I 
    need someone really special to play 
    with them. 

Bonnie is uncertain. Andy sits in front of her, cross-legged. He opens the box, pulls out Jessie and Bullseye.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    This is Jessie -- the roughest, 
    toughest cowgirl in the whole West. 
    She loves critters, but none more’n 
    her best pal, Bullseye. 
    (whinnies; then, as Jessie)
    Yee-haw! Here.

Bonnie looks at her Mom, who nods. She walks forward. Andy 
gives Jessie and Bullseye to her. A smile escapes Bonnie. 

Andy pulls out Rex.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    This is Rex -- the meanest, most 
    terrifying dinosaur who ever lived.
    (dinosaur voice)
    “Raaawwwrrrrr...!!!”

He thrusts Rex at her. Bonnie backs up, grins, takes him. 

            128

Andy pulls out the Potato Heads.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    The Potato Heads -- Mister and 
    Missus. You gotta keep ‘em together 
    ‘cause they’re madly in love. 

Bonnie nods, takes them. Andy pulls out Slinky and Hamm.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    Now Slinky here is as loyal as any 
    dog you could want. But Hamm? He’ll 
    keep your money safe...

He drops a quarter into Hamm’s slot.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    ...but he’s also one of the most 
    dastardly villains of all time...
    (Hamm voice)
    “...Evil Dr. Pork Chop!”

Bonnie smiles, takes them. He pulls out the three Aliens.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    These little dudes are from a 
    strange, alien world -- Pizza Planet!

She smiles. He hands them to her, then pulls out Buzz.

        ANDY (CONT'D)
    And this is Buzz Lightyear -- the 
    coolest toy ever. Look, he can fly... 
    (deploys wings)
    ...And shoot lasers...
    (fires laser)
    He’s sworn to protect the galaxy from 
    the evil Emperor Zurg! 

Andy hands over Buzz. Bonnie presses a button on him.

        BUZZ
    “To Infinity... And Beyond!!!”
    Bonnie looks up, happily surrounded by Andy’s toys. 

        ANDY
    Now, you gotta promise to take good 
    care of these guys. They mean a lot 
    to me.

Bonnie nods. She glances in the box. Her eyes go wide.

        BONNIE 
    My cowboy!

            129

Andy looks down, sees Woody lying in the box.

        ANDY 
    Woody...? What’s he doing in there? 

He lifts Woody out. Bonnie points.

        BONNIE
    “There’s a snake in my boot!”

Andy -- amazed -- pulls Woody’s pull-string.

        WOODY
    (voice-box)
    “There’s a snake in my boot!”

Bonnie giggles and reaches for him, but Andy instinctively 
pulls Woody away. Bonnie looks at Andy, confused. 

Andy looks down at Woody, makes a decision. 

He holds Woody out -- gentle and serious. 

        ANDY 
    Now, Woody -- he’s been my pal as 
    long as I can remember. He’s brave, 
    like a cowboy should be. And kind, 
    and smart. But the thing that makes 
    Woody special? Is he’ll never give 
    up on you -- ever. He’ll be there 
    for you, no matter what. Y’think you 
    can take care of him for me?
    (she nods)
    Okay, then.

He hands Woody to Bonnie. She hugs him. 

Andy suddenly grabs Hamm.

        ANDY (CONT’D)
    Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop’s attacking 
    the haunted bakery! Pchoo! Pchoo! 

Without missing a beat, Bonnie joins in the play.

        BONNIE
    Oh, no! The ghosts are getting away!
    Woody’ll stop ‘em!!

She swoops Woody in the air. Andy grabs Slinky and gives 
chase. They EXIT FRAME, laughing.

        ANDY
    Pchoo! Pchoo! Pchoo!

            130

EXT. BONNIE’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTAGE

Bonnie and Andy play together with all their Toys.

EXT. BONNIE’S HOUSE - DUSK

Andy walks to his car, turns. Bonnie stands on the porch, 
the Toys scattered at her feet. She clutches Woody. 

Bonnie makes Woody’s arm wave at Andy. Andy smiles.

He gets in his car. He takes one last look at all his Toys 
on Bonnie’s porch, and Woody in Bonnie’s arms...

        ANDY 
    Thanks, guys.

...And pulls away.

        BONNIE 
    Look, Mommy! They’re all playing 
    together!

Bonnie puts Woody down and runs to her mother’s arms. 

        BONNIE’S MOM (O.C.) 
    C’mon -- let’s get some lunch.

She scoops up Bonnie, swings her around. Mother and 
daughter laugh as they step into the house.

On the porch, the Toys come to life, sit up.

Woody watches Andy drive away.

        WOODY
    So long, partner.

Buzz puts an arm around Woody. 

They watch Andy drive off. 

The other Toys gather around, and we... 

CRANE UP TO

...Blue sky, and fluffy clouds.

    THE END
